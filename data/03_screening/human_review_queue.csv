REC_01691,Are AI Tools Effective in Reducing Cognitive Load or Boosting Writing Self-Efficacy for L2 Postgraduates?,"The extent to which postgraduate students benefit from AI tools in research-based second-language (L2) writing remains underexplored. This study examined how AI usage impacts writing self-efficacy and cognitive load among postgraduates with varying levels of L2 literacy. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining questionnaire surveys with semi-structured interviews. The findings showed that AI tools significantly benefited only those with lower L2 literacy: AI use positively predicted increased writing self-efficacy without affecting perceived cognitive load. In contrast, for postgraduates with higher L2 literacy, increased AI use did not correlate with improved writing self-efficacy or reduced cognitive load. Qualitative data further indicated that students with lower L2 proficiency primarily valued AI tools for reading lengthy texts along with other benefits. However, those with higher proficiency expressed strong reservations about relying on AI for evaluative reading and idea planning.

REC_07054,Exploring factors influencing educators' adoption of ChatGPT: a mixed method approach,"PurposeA number of recent artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies, including summarisers, paraphrasers and the cutting-edge chatbots not only have outstanding potentials in modern educational systems but also could lead to a dramatic paradigm shift in the whole education process. This study aims to explore the factors that shape the academic community's desire and intention to use AI conversational chatbot technology, with a particular focus on the leading ChatGPT.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a mixed method approach to explore the educators' adoption of chatbots through an empirically validated model. The model, known as the Educators' Adoption of ChatGPT, was developed by integrating the theoretical foundations of both the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Status Quo Bias (SQB) frameworks, as well as insights gathered from interviews. The relationships within this model were then tested using a quantitative approach. The partial least squares-structural equation modelling method was used to analyse 243 valid survey responses.FindingsThe outcomes of the analysis indicated that perceived educators' effort expectancy, educators' autonomous motivation, perceived learners' AI competency, perceived educators' competency, innovative behaviour towards technological agility and perceived students' engagement are significant determinants of educators' intention to use chatbots. In contrast, perceived unfair evaluation of students, perceived students' overreliance and perceived bias/inaccuracies were shown to have significant impacts on the resistance to use the technology, which typically implies a negatively significant influence on the educators' use intention.

The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( beta=0.160 , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( beta=0.140 , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( beta=0.670 , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( beta=0.330 , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( beta=0.760 , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness.

REC_11802,Attitudes toward the adoption of 2 artificial intelligence–enabled mental health tools among prospective psychotherapists: Cross-sectional study,"Background: Despite growing efforts to develop user-friendly artificial intelligence (AI) applications for clinical care, their adoption remains limited because of the barriers at individual, organizational, and system levels. There is limited research on the intention to use AI systems in mental health care. Objective: This study aimed to address this gap by examining the predictors of psychology students’ and early practitioners’ intention to use 2 specific AI-enabled mental health tools based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. Methods: This cross-sectional study included 206 psychology students and psychotherapists in training to examine the predictors of their intention to use 2 AI-enabled mental health care tools. The first tool provides feedback to the psychotherapist on their adherence to motivational interviewing techniques. The second tool uses patient voice samples to derive mood scores that the therapists may use for treatment decisions. Participants were presented with graphic depictions of the tools’ functioning mechanisms before measuring the variables of the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. In total, 2 structural equation models (1 for each tool) were specified, which included direct and mediated paths for predicting tool use intentions. Results: Perceived usefulness and social influence had a positive effect on the intention to use the feedback tool (P< .001) and the treatment recommendation tool (perceived usefulness, P = .01 and social influence, P< .001). However, trust was unrelated to use intentions for both the tools.

REC_00125,Exploring the ‘dark side’ of AI‐powered digital assistants: A moderated mediation model of antecedents and outcomes of perceived creepiness,"Artificial intelligence‐powered digital assistants (DAs) offer benefits, but their downsides can hinder user adoption and limit market potential. Although research exists on users' experiences with DAs, less is known about how user characteristics influence perceptions of a ‘dark side’—perceived creepiness. This study explores how perceived creepiness, user characteristics (uncertainty avoidance), and anxieties triggered by DAs (privacy concerns and technology anxiety) relate to distrust and disengagement from DAs. Based on the stressor‐strain‐outcome and person‐environment fit models, a research model was proposed and tested using survey data from 509 DA users analysed with Amos version 29 software. The results reveal that privacy concerns, uncertainty avoidance, and technology anxiety positively influence perceived creepiness and distrust of DAs, leading to disengagement. Moreover, uncertainty avoidance moderates these relationships, with users higher in uncertainty avoidance experiencing a stronger link between privacy concerns/technology anxiety and perceived creepiness. Importantly, the study shows indirect effects mediated by perceived creepiness, with uncertainty avoidance further moderating these indirect relationships. These findings contribute to literature by highlighting the interplay between user characteristics, DA‐induced anxieties, perceived creepiness, and user disengagement with DAs.

It also explores whether there are statistically significant differences between the identified EI profiles and the purposes for which AI is used. Finally, it examines the association between EI and AI use. A total of 352 students from the University of Alicante participated (184 women, 168 men; mean age = 21.4, SD = 2.3). EI was assessed using the TMMS-24 scale (Attention, Clarity, and Emotional Repair). To evaluate AI use, a 12-item ad hoc questionnaire was developed and validated, comprising three dimensions: educational support, informational support, and emotional support. Cluster analysis identified three EI profiles: (1) high and balanced EI, with high scores across all three dimensions; (2) regulatory EI, characterized by moderate attention and high emotional understanding and regulation; (3) repair-deficit EI, showing difficulties in emotional regulation despite moderate perception and understanding. ANCOVA analyses assessed differences between profiles, showing that students with high and balanced EI perceived greater usefulness of AI for educational and informational support, as well as greater emotional support benefits, compared to other profiles. Finally, positive correlations were found between EI and AI use across all three types of support.

EAITs intelligently assist teachers in formulating better pedagogical decisions or actions for their students. However, teachers are hardly integrating EAITs, and little is known about their perceptions of EAITs. This study seeks to identify human factors that encourage or restrict teachers’ acceptance of EAITs. We propose a revised technology acceptance model incorporating teachers’ pedagogical beliefs and perceived trust in EAITs. Survey data were collected from 215 teachers in South Korea and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results indicate that teachers with constructivist beliefs are more likely to integrate EAITs than teachers with transmissive orientations. Furthermore, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and perceived trust in EAITs are determinants to be considered when explaining teachers’ acceptance of EAITs. Among them, the most influential determinant of predicting their acceptance was found to be how easily the EAIT is constructed.

REC_10021,The effects of response time on older and young adults’ interaction experience with Chatbot,"Background: Chatbots, such as Siri, Alexa, and ChatGPT, are increasingly integrated into various domains, including customer service and virtual companionship, transforming human-computer interactions. However, there remains limited understanding of how response time—a critical social cue—affects user experience across different age groups, particularly in virtual companionship contexts. This gap is especially relevant in aging societies where older adults’ emotional and relational needs require tailored technological solutions. Methods: A 2 × 2 between-subjects experiment was conducted with 160 Taiwanese participants from two age groups: young adults (18–23 years old) and older adults (56–81 years old). Participants interacted with chatbots under two conditions: instant responses (approximately 3 s) and delayed responses (10–60 s). User experience was measured using social presence (SP), service encounter satisfaction (SAT), and intention of use (IOU) through validated questionnaires. Two-way ANOVA was employed to analyze the main and interaction effects of response time and age group. Results: The findings revealed a significant interaction effect between response time and age group. While younger adults preferred instant responses, older adults showed a preference for delayed responses. Specifically: (1) Instant responses led to higher satisfaction and engagement for younger adults, who value efficiency and immediacy. (2) Delayed responses facilitated cognitive comfort and enhanced relational value for older adults, emphasizing the importance of conversational pacing. Conclusions: This study highlights the critical role of response time in chatbot design, revealing how age-specific preferences influence user satisfaction in virtual companionship scenarios. Findings underscore the need for adaptive chatbot designs that align with cognitive and emotional needs across age groups. Broader implications emphasize the importance of balancing digitally assisted companionship with the risks of dehumanization.

Many teachers and students of social science faculty have an inclination to use ChatGPT for educational and research purposes. This study, centering on this specific context, aims to provide insights into the perception and integration of ChatGPT into the educational practices of an emerging country. Methods: This study employed a mixed method approach. Quantitative data were collected through questionnaire survey from 402 teachers and 440 students of eight different public and private universities following a stratified sampling approach. A convenience sampling technique was followed with a view to collecting qualitative data through in-depth interviews of 32 participants, comprising 16 teachers and 16 students from both public and private universities. Results: The study presents that students and teachers both have proficiency, yet a gap in expertise persists. Students perceive ChatGPT as beneficial for better learning outcomes, and teachers find it helpful in preparing for classes and instructional materials. Both teachers and students regard ChatGPT requiring minimal effort. While peer influence drives students to use it, this factor does not influence teachers. However, teachers express stronger behavioral intentions to use it in the future compared to students. Nevertheless, ethical use, reliance, and information accuracy continue to raise concerns. Besides, high cost and language barriers are also listed as reasons for limiting accessibility.

REC_01469,Developing the questionnaire of self-efficacy and needs in using large-language model-based AI services,"The rising prevalence of Large-Language Model-based AI Services (LLMAIs) underscores the importance of understanding users’ self-efficacy and specific needs in engaging with these technologies. Such insights are pivotal for evaluating LLMAI instructional effectiveness and guiding future developments of these technologies. However, current instruments fail to adequately capture these aspects. The study aimed to develop and validate the Questionnaire of Self-efficacy and Needs in using core features of LLMAIs (Q-SNELL). The Q-SNELL was developed through an extensive review of LLMAI core features. Its validation involved content and face validity assessments with a diverse group of experts and common users. Convergent validity, known-groups validity, and test-retest reliability were further evaluated through first and second round online surveys completed by users of LLMAIs. The Q-SNELL comprises three parts: the first focuses on self-efficacy and needs related to the eight core features of LLMAIs; the second includes two items identifying the most frequently used features; and the third assesses general self-efficacy. Content validity showed high agreement (76–100%), while face validity was also strong (80–100%), except for the ease of responding to the scale design (59% and 68% agreement). Validation with 398 participants showed mixed outcomes for convergent validity, strong support for known-groups validity, and moderate to high test-retest reliability (ICC = 0.47 to 0.74).

REC_10785,Functional vs Ethical Drivers in Generative AI Adoption: A PLS-SEM Study in Business Education,"This study examined the factors influencing the use of ChatGPT by university students enrolled in business and management programs, considering the simultaneous effect of their functional perceptions and ethical or academic concerns. Using a structural equation modeling approach (PLS-SEM) applied to a sample of 118 students in Chile, the study found that functional perceptions, such as efficiency, clarity, and cognitive support, exert a positive and significant effect on the use of the tool. By contrast, concerns related to technological dependency, reliability of responses, and academic authorship showed no significant effect on either perception or usage. These findings reveal a functionalist adoption logic in which ethical judgment and pedagogical risks do not act as meaningful barriers. This study contributes to the literature by simultaneously integrating enabling and inhibiting factors into a single explanatory model and providing empirical evidence from a Latin American context. It concludes that there is a pressing need to develop pedagogical and institutional frameworks that foster critical literacy in the use of generative artificial intelligence, particularly in disciplines in which strategic judgment and ethical responsibility are core competencies.

The research aims to identify key drivers and barriers influencing the integration of AI technology in academic settings. A quantitative approach was employed, using a multi-group structural equation model (SEM) analysis to assess data collected from 750 academic researchers across various disciplines (N-pvt = 402; N-pub = 348). The findings reveal that both perceived utility and social influence significantly influence the adoption of AI tools. Higher perceived utility and stronger social influence lead to greater adoption. However, ethical concerns were found to moderate these relationships, particularly in public universities, where researchers with high ethical concerns perceived greater risks, thereby reducing their likelihood of adoption. In contrast, private university researchers showed a higher tolerance for perceived risks when utility and social influence were evident. The study's implications suggest that to promote AI adoption, institutions must address ethical concerns and perceived risks, particularly in public universities, by enhancing transparency, providing ethical guidelines, and offering comprehensive training.

REC_10809,The relationship between students' self-regulated learning skills and technology acceptance of GenAI,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has quickly become prolific in our daily lives, including the higher education sector. Although an AI-fuelled world is unpredictable, there is an urgent need to understand how university students use GenAI to support their learning and the factors influencing GenAI adoption. In this study, underpinned by self-regulated learning (SRL) theory and the technology acceptance model, we examined how university students' adoption of GenAI is influenced by their SRL skills. Given the importance of SRL skills on students' selection of study strategies, we hypothesised that SRL constructs would have a strong association with their adoption of GenAI. To explore this, we conducted an international survey-based study of 435 students from two universities in Australia and Canada to capture students' use of GenAI within the first year of its wider adoption. Our findings reveal that SRL constructs of self-efficacy and social support predict the perceived ease of use of GenAI. Intrinsic motivation and effort regulation also predicted the perceived usefulness of GenAI, with a stronger association for students using GenAI for university learning than those who used it for non-academic purposes such as work or personal use. We discuss implications of our findings for educators. Implications for practice or policy: center dot University teachers should demonstrate and model GenAI use that fosters SRL skill development, such as self-efficacy, social support, intrinsic motivation and effort regulation. center dot University administrators should prioritise academic development to equip instructors with skills for fostering SRL with GenAI tools. center dot The institution should provide guidance on GenAI tool usage and SRL strategies through social support strategies.",2025,WoS,include,uncertain,0.95,0.0,,,"This is an empirical, survey-based quantitative study (n=435) of university students that focuses specifically on GenAI adoption using TAM constructs (perceived ease of use/usefulness).

Employing a cross-sectional design, data were collected from 399 Saudi university EFL students to assess self-reported associations between AI chatbots and writing-related attitudes. The findings indicate that these chatbots were associated with increased self-efficacy, satisfaction and behavioural intention among participants. Participants reported high levels of satisfaction and self-efficacy, moderate levels of AI writing strategies (operationalised usefulness) and strong intention to reuse. The structural equation model results showed that AI writing strategies were significantly associated with satisfaction (8 = .784), self-efficacy (8 = .525) and behavioural intention (8 = .353), where satisfaction and self-efficacy served as mediators of the strategies-intention relationship. These findings highlight the potential of AI to support confidence, develop attitudes and possibly grow skills for second language writing, particularly with younger people who are familiar with technology. Because outcomes were cross-sectional and self-reported, these estimates represent associations that should not be viewed as causal effects. The findings indicate the promise of AI to cultivate students' confidence and positive attitudes towards second language writing, especially when working with younger university learners with a high level of digital exposure.

REC_10822,Assessing structural relationships in pre-service preschool teachers’ perceived AI readiness: Do emotional and psychological aspects matter?,"Preschool pre-service teachers need to be prepared for the age of artificial intelligence (AI) as part of the teaching force; however, much research is still needed in this area. This study aimed to explore the structural relationships in pre-service preschool teachers’ perceived AI readiness, focusing on AI literacy, AI anxiety, AI confidence and AI relevance. The study involved 194 participants from seven universities in Taiwan. Data were analysed using SmartPLS software through partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results confirmed that the constructed model was a good fit for the data, with the adapted questionnaire showing adequate reliability and convergent validity. Key findings highlight the crucial mediating roles of preschool teachers’ AI confidence and AI relevance in connecting their AI literacy to their AI readiness. This suggests that a cognitive understanding of AI does not directly translate into a readiness to use AI without including emotional engagement and perceived usefulness. Moreover, the study identified AI anxiety as a significant negative predictor of AI readiness among preschool teachers.

REC_00841,Exploring user awareness and perceived usefulness of generative AI in higher education: The moderating role of trust,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI), with its distinctive capabilities, is inducing profound transformations across multiple industries. In the realm of higher education, a centered around human intellect and pedagogical advancement, these emerging technologies are at a pivotal juncture of change. Within the scope of GAI, the dynamics of human-technology interaction are significantly influenced by user cognizance, encompassing an understanding and experiential knowledge of technological features. This study investigates the impact of GAI adoption in higher education, focusing on how user awareness influences perceived utility through the lens of the Status Quo Bias (SQB) theory. The research employs a quantitative approach using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to examine the relationships between various factors affecting GAI implementation in educational settings. The findings reveal significant effects on user awareness from two main dimensions: individual commitment to resistance and technology affordance. In the individual commitment to resistance dimension, both sunk cost and privacy concerns demonstrated significant influences on user awareness. Within the technology affordance dimension, explainability, accountability, and transparency showed significant positive effects on user awareness. These results provide valuable insights for higher education institutions implementing GAI technologies, suggesting that successful adoption requires careful consideration of both individual resistance factors and technological affordance features.

REC_00840,Extending the TAM framework: Exploring learning motivation and agility in educational adoption of generative AI,"Generative AI technologies are rapidly transforming educational practices, creating both opportunities and challenges for teacher-preparation programs. As these advanced tools become increasingly prevalent in classrooms, understanding the factors that influence pre-service teachers' acceptance and adoption of such technologies has become critically important for effective educational policies and practices. This study aims to extend the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine the factors influencing pre-service teachers' adoption of generative AI tools. The research is based on data collected from 748 pre-service teachers from 12 universities in Turkey. The model includes the core constructs of TAM as well as exogenous variables such as Metacognitive Self-regulation (MSR), Subjective Norm (SN), Learning Motivation (LM) and Learning Agility (LA). The results of Structural Equation Modeling showed that the model explained 54% of the variance in Attitude and 51% of the variance in Behavioral Intention. MSR and LM had significant effects on Perceived Usefulness and Perceived Ease of Use, while LA and SN were found to be effective only on Perceived Ease of Use. These findings highlight that intrinsic cognitive and motivational factors are more influential than external social factors in determining how pre-service teachers evaluate the usefulness of generative AI tools. Additionally, our study reveals that learning agility significantly contributes to perceived ease of use, suggesting that adaptability is a key factor in technological adoption among educators. These results suggest that training programs for generative AI in teacher education should prioritize hands-on activities that strengthen self-regulation skills and intrinsic motivation, rather than focusing solely on technical features. Curriculum designers and teacher educators should create learning environments that nurture adaptability and metacognitive skills to facilitate successful integration of AI technologies in future educational practices.",2025,WoS; Scopus,include,uncertain,0.96,0.9,,,"This is a quantitative empirical SEM study with primary data from 748 pre-service teachers in universities, focused specifically on generative AI adoption within an educational population.

Subsequently, statistical analysis of the data was carried out to obtain results, which indicated that conscientiousness and extraversion correlated positively with positive attitudes towards AI, while agreeableness, neuroticism and intellect/imagination correlated negatively with those attitudes. Furthermore, it was found that extraversion, conscientiousness and neuroticism were positively correlated with the frequency of AI usage in foreign language learning, while intellect/imagination was negatively correlated with both the frequency of AI usage and the perceived usefulness of AI tools in foreign language learning. Finally, the study revealed an association between the frequency of AI use and the perceived usefulness of AI-generated tools, as well as a strong direct effect of the frequency of AI usage in foreign language learning on attitudes towards AI. Overall, the use of AI-generated tools appears to be more dependent on the learner’s attitudes towards AI than their personality traits. © Artykuł jest udostępniany na licencji Creative Commons - Uznanie autorstwa-Na tych samych warunkach 4.0 Międzynarodowe, https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/.",2025,Scopus,include,uncertain,0.93,0.5,,,"This is an empirical quantitative survey of 429 university foreign-language learners examining AI attitudes, frequency of AI use, and perceived usefulness in an educational context.

A total of 200 IT engineering students at the University of Belgrade, Faculty of Organizational Sciences, completed the devised survey. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed to investigate paths between proposed model constructs. Based on the results of the study, all original TAM hypotheses were confirmed. Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU) positively influences Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Behavioral Intention (BI). At the same time, PU positively affects BI which positively affects the Actual Usage (AU) of ChatGPT for achieving educational goals. Also, it was shown that self-efficacy does positively affect PEOU and PU. PS affects BI and is influenced by PU and PEOU factors.

REC_15382,Factors Affecting the Adoption of AI-Based Applications in Higher Education: An Analysis of Teachers' Perspectives Using Structural Equation Modeling,"Owing to the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, there has been increasing concern about how to promote the use of AI technologies in school settings to enhance students' learning performance. Teachers' intention to adopt AI tools in their classes plays a crucial role in this regard. Therefore, it is important to explore factors affecting teachers' intention to incorporate AI technologies or applications into course designs in higher education. In this study, a structural equation modeling approach was employed to investigate teachers' continuance intention to teach with AI. In the proposed model, 10 hypotheses regarding anxiety (AN), self-efficacy (SE), attitude towards Al (ATU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and perceived usefulness (PU) were tested, and this study explored how these factors worked together to influence teachers' continuance intention. A total of 311 teachers in higher education participated in the study. Based on the SEM analytical results and the research model, the five endogenous constructs of PU, PEU, SN, and ATU explained 70.4% of the changes in BI. In this model, SN and PEU were the determining factors of BI. The total effect of ATU was 0.793, followed by SE, with a total effect of 0.554. As a result, the intentions of teachers to learn to use AI-based applications in their teaching can be predicted by ATU, SE, PEU, PU and AN. Among them, teachers' SE positively influenced teachers' PEU and ATU towards adopting AI-based applications, and also influenced PU through PEU. In addition, the relationship between teachers' SE and AN was negatively correlated, which indicated that enhancing teachers' SE could reduce their AN towards using AI-based applications in their teaching.

REC_07274,Integrating Tam and UGT to explore students’ motivation for using ChatGPT for learning in Vietnam,"Purpose: This study combines the TAM and UGT frameworks to investigate how Vietnamese students' views of ChatGPT and intrinsic needs affect their intentions to use it for education (via variables including perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, novelty, information seeking and academic content creation). We will employ TAM theory (Davis, 1989) and UGT theory to elucidate university students' motivations for utilising ChatGPT in Vietnam. Simultaneously, we aim to address the limitation stemming from data uniformity. Our research will make a substantial contribution to the understanding of researchers regarding the use of ChatGPT and its varied consequences as it grows and develops. Design/methodology/approach: This study was conducted at a private university in Vietnam with an estimated population of 15,000 students. One of Vietnam’s top private information technology institutions requires its students to use a variety of information and communication technologies (ICTs) on a regular basis to facilitate and enjoy their academic pursuits (Ngo, 2024; Nguyen). Students who are familiar with ChatGPT and have access to it for educational purposes are the ones that were chosen. This research is a quantitative study that utilises primary data through a survey method. Participants answered a questionnaire online through the Google Form platform sharing via social media platforms from October to December 2023. The questionnaire was divided into two sections: the first contained screening questions and demographic information and the second had five-point Likert-scale questions that measured the study’s components. Two screening questions are used to separate out the intended responders. (i.e. “I have heard the name ChatGPT” and “I know about ChatGPT”) were set to find whether the participants had any knowledge of ChatGPT. If participants were unaware of ChatGPT, their responses were not included in the study. A total of 283 responses were received. The participant’s demographic information is shown in Table 1. It is believed that a sample size of more than 200 provides adequate statistical power for data analysis in structural equation modelling. It is evident that the 283-sample size in this study is adequate to evaluate the research hypothesis and the fitting model. 42.9% of the 283 research samples were made up of men, while 57.1% were women. Business administration accounted for 40.1% of survey respondents, followed by information technology (25.2%) and English language (14.5%). The average ChatGPT usage time of respondents was 56 min in a single use. The study sample’s average age is 20–72 years old. Findings: The present study contributes to the existing AI chatbot literature in the educational industry in several ways. First, this study addresses a gap in the literature by investigating the factors that influence students’ ITU ChatGPT for educational purposes in Vietnam. Using the extended model, we investigated factors influencing students’ intentions to use ChatGPT. It integrates three motive factors of the UGT (ACT, IS and N) with the core factors of TAM (PeoU and PU). The integrated framework’s findings indicate that in a Vietnamese educational setting, ChatGPT is a novel technology that should be considered in conjunction with PU and PEoU. Research limitations/implications: First, only Vietnamese students make up the research sample. To increase the relevance of the findings, it is advised that future research look at the study model in various geographic regions. Second, the present investigation’s constraints arise from the lack of clarity about the Chat GPT version utilised by the respondents, specifically whether it was the free or premium edition. Furthermore, the limited duration of the survey presents an obstacle to gathering thorough data. Due to their reliance on the particular features and functionalities of the Chat GPT version used, these restrictions may have an effect on the researcher’s objectivity. Furthermore, the limited survey time may curtail the coverage of the collected answers, particularly considering that our survey predominantly focuses on business administration students, thus limiting the diversity and richness of the gathered data. We recommend that future studies should conduct comparative research between different versions of GPT Chat, including free and paid variants that can provide valuable insights into potential differences in performance and results. Such analysis can provide a deeper understanding of the strengths and limitations of different GPT Chat versions. Third, because the study focused on behavioural intention, actual usage and post-usage behaviour may not be covered by the findings. To gain a deeper understanding of users' actual behaviour, we suggest doing research on their usage and post-usage behaviours. Practical implications: The findings will assist service providers and legislators in determining critical variables and influencing students' incentives to use ChatGPT in educational settings that use constructivist teaching methods. As a result, the information will assist service providers in creating AI chatbots that are more user-friendly, visually appealing, efficient, safe and convenient for education. Governments, in conjunction with service providers, have the potential to significantly accelerate the adoption of AI-based chatbots by highlighting their ethical and sustainable use. The findings demonstrate that students' ITU towards ChatGPT is substantially impacted by PU and PEoU. It is recommended that service providers emphasize the advantages and ease of use of AI chatbots in order to draw new clients. Additionally, in order to promote ChatGPT or related technologies, marketers should concentrate on raising the technology’s perceived novelty value. This is because people are open to new technologies as long as they believe they are interesting and innovative. Originality/value: ChatGPT is an advanced AI-powered chatbot that has the potential to advance and revolutionize the learning and teaching process. This study attempted to look at the elements that lead students to want to use ChatGPT from an academic standpoint by combining the UGT and TAM. For practitioners, academics and educators, the findings provide a solid knowledge of and encouragement for the sustainable use of such AI tools.

REC_00854,AI-driven academic engagement in fine arts education: the chain-mediating roles of self-efficacy and achievement emotions,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into fine arts education has reshaped students' academic engagement, but the mechanisms underlying this influence remain underexplored. Grounded in Social Cognitive Theory And Control-Value Theory, to examine the mechanism of AI-driven academic engagement, we first collected survey data from 2,826 fine arts students across 18 Chinese universities and then analyzed it using a Structural Equation Model. The results reveal that AI usage enhances engagement through both a substantial direct effect (beta = 0.298) and multiple indirect pathways. Among the mediators, achievement emotions (indirect effect beta = 0.189) emerged as a significantly more powerful pathway than self-efficacy (beta = 0.074). The study also validates a sequential chain-mediation pathway (AI usage -> self-efficacy -> achievement emotions -> academic engagement in art practice), clarifying the process by which cognitive gains translate into affective drivers of engagement. The key practical implication is that to maximize engagement, educators should strategically manage the full sequential pathway, leveraging AI-driven enhancements in self-efficacy as a foundational step to cultivate positive achievement emotions, which this study identifies as the most potent mediating factor.",2025,WoS; Scopus,include,include,0.92,1.0,,,"This is an empirical quantitative survey study in an educational population (fine arts students) with AI usage as a focal construct, analyzed via SEM with standardized beta effects reported.

The risks to which AI exposes universities are diverse. Indeed, unhealthy use of AI runs the risk of turning ethics into an academic and scientific mirage. Based on a quantitative study of 239 academics from Tunisian universities in Tunis, Nabeul and Sousse, the key findings of SEM revealed that the use of artificial intelligence among male academics significantly and positively influences scientific research but significantly and negatively influences their ethical behaviour. The latter was found to significantly and negatively influences their scientific research. For female academics, the use of artificial intelligence significantly and positively influences both scientific research and ethical behaviour. The latter was found to significantly and positively influence scientific research. Unlike their male counterparts, female academics produce fewer scientific works. However, for them, ethics is of paramount importance and governs their scientific research practices. For women academics, ethics is not limited to a set of academic norms but symbolises a deeper reflection of the values that underpin their behaviour in scientific research. The results have implications for academics and decision-makers on the impact of ethics as a mediator between artificial intelligence usage and scientific research.",2025,WoS,include,uncertain,0.89,0.0,,,"This is a quantitative SEM study with primary data from 239 university academics, with AI usage as a focal construct in an educational context.

REC_10950,Understanding university students' adoption of ChatGPT: A TAM-based exploration of key factors,"The rapid rise of AI chatbots like ChatGPT has spurred growing interest in understanding the factors that influence their adoption, especially in educational settings. This study focuses on identifying the key elements that shape university students' intentions to use ChatGPT, using the technology acceptance model (TAM) as the theoretical foundation. The research integrates core constructs such as perceived ease of use (PEU), perceived usefulness (PU), perceived risk, trust, and technostress to examine their influence on the intention to use (IU) ChatGPT. Survey data from Indian university students were analyzed using the Smart PLS structural equation modeling technique. The findings reveal significant relationships between PEU, PU, and IU. Specifically, PEU emerged as a strong determinant of both PU and IU, underlining the importance of a user-friendly, intuitive interface in promoting ChatGPT adoption. Additionally, perceived risk was found to negatively impact IU, suggesting that addressing concerns related to privacy and misinformation is crucial for fostering trust and encouraging use. Although technostress had a smaller effect, it still played a notable role, indicating that the stress associated with using new technologies needs to be managed effectively through support mechanisms. Interestingly, trust did not significantly affect IU, challenging assumptions about its role in AI-driven technology adoption. This raises important questions about the specific factors that contribute to trust in such tools. The study's findings reaffirm the relevance of TAM constructs in understanding ChatGPT adoption while also highlighting the importance of emotional and cognitive factors, such as perceived risk and stress. These findings contribute to the growing academic discussion surrounding AI chatbot adoption and offer actionable insights for AI developers, educators, and policymakers. This research highlights the importance of addressing both technical and emotional factors to ensure broader acceptance and effective use of AI technologies like ChatGPT in learning environments.",2025,WoS; Scopus,include,uncertain,0.88,0.0,,,"The abstract describes a quantitative survey of university students using TAM constructs to predict intention to use ChatGPT, with SmartPLS SEM and reported significant paths, which strongly fits AI adoption meta-analysis criteria.

REC_00861,Academics as adopters of generative AI: an application of diffusion of innovations theory,"The background for this research is an ongoing discussion towards generative AI in the higher education context. This study aimed to understand the factors influencing the adoption of generative artificial intelligence by academicians, utilizing the Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory. Drawing on Rogers' Diffusion of Innovations (DOI) theory, this study investigates the antecedents of ChatGPT adoption among 640 academics from ten major Polish universities. Seven hypotheses were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results reveal that relative advantage (beta = 0.240), compatibility (beta = 0.214), and perceived complexity (beta = 0.383) significantly influence behavioural intention, which in turn strongly predicts actual use (beta = 0.558). Trialability exerts a modest but significant effect on intention (beta = 0.071), whereas observability is non-significant (beta = - 0.004). Personal innovativeness further enhances actual use (beta = 0.209). Collectively, the model explains 49.6% of variance in behavioural intention and 45.0% in actual usage. The results suggest that ChatGPT is perceived by academicians as a tool that facilitates and enhances academic and teaching work. The study fills a gap in the literature regarding the adoption of ChatGPT in academia from the DOI perspective.

REC_00862,Thorough exploration or superficial engagement: Relationship between generative artificial intelligence acceptance and college students' learning outcomes in different use contexts,"Generative artificial intelligence (Gen AI) has attracted significant scholarly attention due to its transformative impact on the learning processes of college students. The acceptance and application of Gen AI among college students can influence their learning outcomes. However, the intricate relationship between these factors, along with the underlying mechanisms, requires further exploration. Guided by the knowledge transformation model in the context of human-intelligence interaction, this study surveyed 2,947 college students to explore the relationship between Gen AI acceptance and college students' learning outcomes. It further investigated the mediating role of learning strategies and further tested the heterogeneous relationships and mechanisms across different contexts. The results indicate that, firstly, Gen AI acceptance enhances college students' knowledge gain, ability gain, and value gain. Secondly, Gen AI acceptance enhances knowledge gain, ability gain, and value gain by promoting deep learning strategies, while it decreases these gains by increasing surface learning. Thirdly, distinct mechanisms exist within the contexts of curriculum learning, scientific research, and daily life. The findings of this study contribute to understanding the relationship between Gen AI acceptance and college students' learning outcomes while revealing the mechanisms within diverse contexts. These insights can guide educators in designing targeted teaching strategies, assist institutions in formulating policies for the responsible use of next-generation artificial intelligence, and support the creation of training programs that strengthen students' digital competencies and related skills.

REC_11030,Lecturers' pathways to integrating artificial intelligence in business and economics curricula,"Objective: This article aims to identify the factors affecting business and economics lecturers' inclusion of artificial intelligence (AI) in the curricula. Research Design & Methods: We applied a quantitative approach to test a research model based on the theory of planned behaviour. We used partial least squares structural equation modelling to verify hypotheses using a sample of 133 university lecturers from business and economics. Findings: The study reveals that key background factors, including prior AI education and prior AI use, indirectly contribute to the inclusion of AI in the curricula. AI education contributed by enhancing lecturers' cognitive attitudes and self-efficacy and AI use only contributed through self-efficacy. Contrary to expectations, previous instances of AI integration in teaching have had an insignificant influence on the inclusion of AI into the curriculum. Implications & Recommendations: The inclusion of AI in business and economics university teaching is a precondition for equipping graduates with skills expected in the job market. Based on the findings of this study, two paths seem to be particularly helpful in achieving this objective: improving lecturers' attitudes via AI education and improving their self-efficacy through personal AI use.

REC_11029,Understanding artificial intelligence chatbot quality and experience: A higher education student perspective,"Objective: The article aims to identify the key aspects that define service quality for artificial intelligence chatbots (AICB) in higher education, based on insights from students. The second objective is to put AICB quality into the broader context of other key variables associated with student experience of AICB, such as AICB adoption, AICB usability, AICB engagement, and AICB mistrust. Research Design & Methods: Based on extant service quality research and established scale development techniques, the study constructs, refines, and validates a multidimensional AICB service quality scale through a series of pilot and validation studies. The article includes both qualitative and quantitative technics, as we developed a questionnaire based on a literature review and 48 mini focus group interviews. In total, 308 participants filled out the questionnaire. For the analyses, we applied both exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis together with scale validation and correlation analysis. Findings: We began the AICB service quality scale with 27 items across five dimensions: AICB quality, AICB mistrust, AICB usability, AICB adoption, and AICB engagement. The final scale consisted of 15 items across four dimensions with only AI engagement left out. Data analysis emphasised the critical role of AI quality in AI usability and AI adoption. The research also confirmed AI mistrust is an important aspect with a negative connection to AI quality. Implications & Recommendations: The study results have several theoretical and practical implications. From the theoretical standpoint, we confirmed that the quality of artificial intelligence (AI) plays a central role in forming student experience. Quality of AICB received the highest score in this analysis (5.03) while AICB mistrust scored lowest (3.58). On the other hand, when it comes to individual correlations between student experience elements and AICB quality, mistrust in AICB shows a negative correlation with the highest score (-0.48). Use and adoption are both connected to AICB quality in a positive way. Results show us there is room for improvement in both AICB quality and student experience since average scores were in the range of 4.5-5.0. The results also emphasised the importance of reducing AICB mistrust for improving AICB quality and overall experience. Contribution & Value Added: The AICB quality scale facilitates theory development by providing a reliable scale to improve the current understanding of student perceptions regarding different aspects of AICB quality.

The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) was used to analyze cognitive factors, while qualitative data explored emotional trust, ethical concerns and institutional support. Findings indicate: Performance expectancy and effort expectancy significantly influence students' attitudes toward AI. Attitude strongly predicts behavioral intention, which in turn leads to actual adoption. Perceived risk, such as concerns about accuracy and plagiarism, was acknowledged but did not significantly impact attitude. Students adopt AI tools strategically, often validating outputs through textbooks or peer input. Institutional support and faculty guidance influence adoption, but formal policies are often unclear.

However, a comprehensive understanding of how these technologies influence the motivational aspects of language learning remains limited. Addressing this gap, this study explores the broader relationship between individual engagement with various AI-based tools and their motivational impact on English learning, moving beyond the focus on specific AI tools. To achieve the research objectives, engagement with AI-based programs was examined in relation to awareness, experience, and interest in the future use of AI-based programs. Then, the relationships between these AI-related elements and motivational variables (such as self-efficacy and ideal L2 self) in language learning were investigated. Finally, the influence of adaptability was explored in these specific relationships. For this study, convenience sampling was employed to collect data from 180 Korean students who were enrolled in an English course at a university in South Korea. Hierarchical regression and mediation analyses revealed that students’ awareness and experience significantly influenced their interest in the future use of AI-based applications. Among the three AI-related elements, awareness and interest in future use were related to language learning motivation, specifically, self-efficacy and ideal L2 self. Notably, adaptability was identified as a mediating factor in the relationship between awareness of AI and the motivational variables.

REC_14737,Learners' Adoption of Course Recommendation Systems by Integrating External Factors and Technology Acceptance Model,"The use of the course recommendation systems is an important focus of research in the field of educational technology. Understanding how students interact with them and accept these systems is essential as the learning environment is changing due to the integration of digital platforms. The Recommendation systems (RSs) are useful tools for narrowing down the course options and exposing students to the courses that suit their needs. The majority of the research related to recommendation systems focuses on effectiveness rather than factors influencing its acceptability, and in practice, user satisfaction cannot be explained by accuracy alone. This study considers the course recommendation systems and examines whether the courses proposed by our recommender systems (RS) are accepted by learners, particularly research students, based on their learning requirements. This can help researchers understand why some users embrace new technology while others resist it. Therefore, research scholars (n=150) willingly engaged in this study were asked to use the RS and complete a questionnaire based on their experience as part of a self-administrated longitudinal survey. This study evaluates the effect of external variables that the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) does not account for, such as perceived availability, relevance, and experience. It also evaluates the recommendation system’s capacity for making accurate recommendations. When compared to our keyword (75.11% accuracy) and N-gram (89.85%) based approaches, the accuracy of our hybrid recommendation was calculated to be 95.25 percent. The findings further support the extended TAM’s role as a useful theoretical framework for explaining academics’ acceptance of RS and other elements that have a positive bearing on the TAM’s core variables. Consequently, a new modified TAM that includes three outside elements is proposed. The results’ validity and dependability are confirmed by the significant value calculated for Cronbach’s alpha.

The model, based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), introduces two new constructs- perceived trust and technology anxiety- to offer a more comprehensive insight into adoption behavior in undergraduate and postgraduate students. The survey was done on a non-probability convenience basis by using a structured survey. Out of the 300 questionnaires circulated, 175 valid responses were analyzed based on partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM).

REC_06066,Economics students' behavioural intention and usage of ChatGPT in higher education: a hybrid structural equation modelling-artificial neural network approach,"The Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, popularly referred to as ChatGPT, is an AI-based technology with the potential to revolutionise conventional teaching and learning in higher education institutions (HEIs). However, it remains unclear which factors influence the behavioural intentions and the actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students in Ghanaian HEIs. In pursuit of this goal, we employed the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) to gain a better understanding of the antecedents influencing the behavioural intentions and actual usage of ChatGPT among economics students. The study surveyed 306 Ghanaian students enrolled in economics at a public university. These students were aware of the existence of ChatGPT applications. We applied a hybrid analytical approach, combining structural equation modelling and artificial neural network (SEM-ANN), to elucidate the causal relationships between variables believed to impact perceived trust, intentions, and actual usage. The results showed that design and interactivity have a significant impact on perceived trust. Similarly, perceived trust, social influence, performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and habits drive behavioural intentions. Among the various factors influencing behavioural intentions, hedonic motivation emerged as the most dominant. Moreover, behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions significantly drive students' actual use of the ChatGPT. Nevertheless, ethics is not a significant factor in perceived trust, and effort expectancy does not affect behavioral intention.

REC_14783,AI AS A FACILITATOR OF CREATIVITY AND WELLBEING IN BUSINESS STUDENTS: A MULTIGROUP APPROACH BETWEEN PUBLIC AND PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES,"Objective: This article aims to explore the effect of perceived adaptability, perceived usefulness, and ease of use of AI on the creativity and well-being (happiness) of business students in universities in Mexico. Additionally, it seeks to analyse how these relationships differ between students from public and private universities, using a multi-group approach. Method: A non-experimental quantitative approach with a cross-sectional design was adopted. The sample included 270 business students from both a public and a private university in Mexico. Data collection was conducted through an online questionnaire, using previously validated scales to measure perceived usefulness, ease of use, AI adoption, creativity, and happiness. Data were analysed using structural equation modelling (SEM) and multi-group analysis (MGA) to assess differences between groups. Results: The main findings indicate that AI adoption significantly mediates the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and outcomes in terms of creativity and well-being. AI adoption was found to have a stronger influence on creativity in public institutions, while its impact on happiness was more pronounced in private universities. These differences suggest that in resource-limited contexts, AI may compensate for the lack of other resources, enhancing creativity. Conclusion: This study expands the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by including variables such as creativity and happiness, highlighting the importance of the socio-economic context in technological adoption in universities. The implications suggest that public institutions should focus on improving access to technologies such as AI, while private institutions must ensure ethical and responsible use, promoting both academic performance and student well-being.",2025,WoS; Scopus,include,uncertain,0.94,0.0,,,"The abstract describes a quantitative, cross-sectional SEM study of 270 university business students where AI adoption is explicitly measured and modeled as a mediator, satisfying the education-adoption focus.

However, the specific ways in which the appearance anthropomorphism of digital teachers influences the delivery of different knowledge types remain insufficiently understood. Drawing on Embodied Learning Theory and Parasocial Interaction Theory, this study investigates how digital teachers' appearance (cartoonish versus realistic) interacts with knowledge types (explicit versus tacit) to affect digital learning satisfaction and usage intention, exploring the mediating roles of physical and social presence. Initially, we implemented a 2 × 2 experimental design using a large language model application, collecting data from 475 participants to empirically test our hypotheses. Subsequently, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 Chinese university students to further validate and clarify the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions. The results indicate that digital teachers with a cartoonish appearance are more effective for delivering explicit knowledge, whereas digital teachers with a realistic appearance excel in conveying tacit knowledge. Both physical presence and social presence were found to significantly mediate these effects.

We analyzed data via correlation and regression using SPSS v26. Results High AI anxiety (mean = 80.3, SD = 9.4) contrasted with positive attitudes (mean = 114.3, SD = 12.8). Regression identified attitude as the strongest predictor of anxiety (B = 5.171, p < .001), alongside younger age, female gender, and non-use of AI. Academic year and AI education showed no significant effects. Conclusion Negative attitudes and limited AI exposure drive anxiety, particularly among younger females and non-users. To mitigate this, we recommend integrating AI literacy modules into curricula, fostering hands-on AI experiences, and designing gender-sensitive training.

This study explores students' perceptions of AI tools in academic writing at Thu Dau Mot University (TDMU). A mixed-methods research design examined Technological Acceptance Model (TAM) factors including Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Attitude towards Behavior (ATT), and Behavioral Intention (BI) with respect to understand importance of usability and perception in user adoption of AI's role in academic writing. The objective was to examine how AI affected the quality and originality of students' writing, and explore the opportunities and challenges they perceived. The sample comprised 212 second-year English-majored students, who demonstrated having the experience of using AI tools in academic writing. A questionnaire and an interview survey were used for data collection. The ten interview informants were randomly picked from the pool of respondents of the questionnaire. SPSS version 20 was used to statistically analyze the data, reliability testing and mean and standard deviation calculations. Findings indicate that Perceived Ease of Use positively affects Perceived Usefulness and Attitude towards Behavior, suggesting that ease of use enhances both the perceived benefits and favorable attitudes toward the system. Additionally, Perceived Usefulness positively influences Attitude, reinforcing that users who find the system helpful tend to develop a positive attitude toward it. These findings highlight the need for educators and policymakers to integrate AI tools in academic writing. Educators must emphasize AI as a support tool, not a replacement for student effort.

REC_14845,University Student Attitudes Towards Artificial Intelligence Integration into their Academic Performance,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more common in education, so it is crucial to be aware of students' perspectives towards the effective use of implementing AI in education. This study employed a mixed-methods approach to incorporate a researcher-made questionnaire with 385 participants and semi-structured interviews with 69 students from three institutions in Vietnam. Descriptive statistics and correlation analysis were used to examine the quantitative data, and thematic analysis was employed to address the qualitative data. The results reveal that although the participants have neutral stances on the acceptability of AI in education, they also express positive and negative opinions on the acceptance and uncertainty about AI's capabilities to enhance their academic performance. Besides, digital skills, previous experience with AI, institutional support, and ethical concerns are the main factors of acceptance and use. The participants feel concerned about whether the AI application may improve their academic integrity, privacy, and critical thinking. It is, therefore, necessary for students to receive institutional support for AI training by providing more explicit principles and resources for AI adoption. Additionally, the study reveals that AI has great potential, but it should be integrated into higher education with considerable care to solve ethical issues and allow the students to be trained and supported.

This study aims to explore the psychological, technological, and social factors that influence the acceptance of AI among Hungarian university students and to identify different user groups based on their attitudes. The methodological novelty lies in combining two approaches: partial least-squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and cluster analysis. The survey, based on the TAM and UTAUT models, involved 302 Hungarian students and examined six dimensions of AI acceptance: perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitude, social influence, enjoyment and behavioural intention. The PLS-SEM results show that enjoyment (beta = 0.605) is the strongest predictor of the intention to use AI, followed by usefulness (beta = 0.167). All other factors also had significant effects. Cluster analysis revealed four groups: AI sceptics, moderately open users, positive acceptors, and AI innovators.

The study also sought to establish the perception and attitude of the foreign language students toward using GenAI in learning the foreign language. The current study employed a quantitative research approach to evaluate the current sample of lecturers and students’ attitudes toward the implementation of Generative AI (GenAI) systems in teaching and learning foreign languages. The sample involved 45 lecturers and 493 postgraduate students in foreign languages from Saudi Arabia. The survey questionnaire contained items based on the UTAUT model, which includes 15 items, of which four are based on performance expectancy, four on effort expectancy, three on social influence, and four on facilitating conditions. The survey took the form of Google Forms shared on social media and email. The data collected was analysed using descriptive statistics, and t-test results were obtained to see the overall influence of two sets of behavioural perceptions of the two groups. A comparative analysis of the attitudes reveals that lecturers had a positive optimism with relative efforts and facilitating conditions needed for the adoption and integration of GenAI in FL education (Mean = 4.29, SD = 0.79, Variance = 0.81, t = 2.45, p= 0.015).

AI-powered tools are new and underutilised in higher education. The fact that students and teachers need knowledge to use these apps in the classroom compounds the issue. Despite this technology's recent academic introduction, nothing is known about its impacts. In order to investigate the variables that influence the continual intention to employ artificial intelligence, this study discusses the possibility of integrating the self-determination theory (SDT) and technology acceptance model (TAM) with the post-acceptance model (PAM). Three hundred forty university students were solicited to complete a questionnaire to collect data for the proposed model. A dual-stage approach uses both symmetrical assumptions from structural equation modelling with partial least squares (PLS-SEM) and asymmetrical configurations from fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). In order to better comprehend the intricate interplay between the model's inputs and its desired output, this approach is devised. Consideration is given to the fact that various configurations of external constructs exert distinct influences on internal constructs. In Thailand, perceived usefulness (PU) and autonomy predict continued AI-powered tool use. Perceived ease of use (PEOU) did not affect continuing intention. Conclusions drawn from the configurational analysis show that no single factor adequately explains a high CI level.

These chatbots are able to synthesize an enormous amount of data input and can create contextually aware, human-like conversational content that is not limited to simple scripted responses. This study examines the factors that determine chatbot brand trust in the adoption of GenAI in higher education. By extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the construct of brand trust, the study introduces a novel contribution to the literature, offering fresh insights into how trust in GenAI chatbots is developed within the academic context. Using the convenience sampling technique, a sample of 609 students from public universities in North Central and Southwestern Nigeria was selected. The collected data were analyzed via partial least squares structural equation modelling. The results indicated that attitudes toward chatbots determine behavioral intentions and GenAI chatbot brand trust. Surprisingly, behavioral intentions do not affect GenAI chatbot brand trust. Similarly, the perceived ease of use of chatbots does not determine behavioral intention or attitudes toward GenAI chatbot adoption but rather determines perceived usefulness. Additionally, the perceived usefulness of chatbots affects behavioral intention and attitudes toward GenAI chatbot adoption. Moreover, social influence affects behavioral intention, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness and attitudes toward GenAI chatbot adoption.

From online learning platforms to interactive educational games and virtual reality simulations, technology has transformed the traditional classroom into a vi-brant, engaging, and inclusive educational landscape. A notable advancement in artificial intelligence technology is ChatGPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), which provides personalized and effective learning experiences by delivering customized feedback and explanations to stu-dents. Despite the considerable research on the adoption or acceptance of e-learning, there is a paucity of research on the acceptance and utilization of ChatGPT, highlighting the need for further investigation.

The launch of the ChatGPT-3 posed great challenges for higher education, given its popularity among university students. The present study aimed to analyze the attitudes of university students toward the use of ChatGPTs in their academic activities.Method This study was oriented toward a quantitative approach and had a nonexperimental design. An online survey was administered to the 499 participants.Results The findings of this study revealed a significant association between various factors and attitudes toward the use of the ChatGPT. The higher beta coefficients for responsible use (beta=0.806***), the intention to use frequently (beta=0.509***), and acceptance (beta=0.441***) suggested that these are the strongest predictors of a positive attitude toward ChatGPT. The presence of positive emotions (beta=0.418***) also plays a significant role. Conversely, risk (beta=-0.104**) and boredom (beta=-0.145**) demonstrate a negative yet less decisive influence. These results provide an enhanced understanding of how students perceive and utilize ChatGPTs, supporting a unified theory of user behavior in educational technology contexts.Conclusion Ease of use, intention to use frequently, acceptance, and intention to verify information influenced the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT responsibly.

Using Amos version 23 structural equation modelling and 880 student survey responses, the suggested model was empirically tested. According to the report, students think well of ChatGPT utilization in the classroom. Credibility, Usefulness and ease of use, all influence how positively people feel about using this technology in a classroom setting. The study's findings, however, did not support the notion that students' adoption and use of ChatGPT was insignificantly influenced by perceived enjoyment. Moreover, the results conclude that attitude mediates the relationship between usefulness and intention to use ChatGPT. The research will help businesses, educational institutions, and the global community by providing insight into how students view the ChatGPT service within a learning environment. Additionally, the application boosts learners' confidence and interest, which improves general awareness and literacy. Finally, the research will facilitate developers of AI in the betterment of their product and service delivery and regulators in regulating the use of AI-based bots.

REC_07863,Are pre-service teachers disinclined to utilise embodied humanoid social robots in the classroom?,"Teachers' readiness for technology integration depends also on their beliefs about the contribution of technology to teaching and learning, which influence their motivation for its adoption. Initial pre-service teacher education is critical in reducing the attitude-behaviour divide supporting technology acceptability, acceptance and use. Acceptance of interaction between human and robot is more complicated than human-computer interaction acceptance. Social robots are radical innovations, harder for potential users to accept in human social spaces than are incremental innovations. In 2019, a survey using a convenience sample of 121 first-year students was conducted to examine pre-service teachers' beliefs about social robot educational technology. It examined the following factors derived from the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology adopted for social robots in education: Perceived social dimension, Intention to use, Perceived usability, Anxiety. Based on our findings, it seems there is a critical disjunction between researchers' efforts to equip social robots with human manners and social intelligence and participants' rejection of this technology precisely because it mimics being human. Further, we report that ICT familiarity as assessed using PISA's Information Communication Technology-ICT familiarity factors is related to robot acceptability. These findings need further examination to inform educational robotics design and Human-Robot Interaction research and teacher education and training. Practitioners notes What is already known about this topic In the age of robotic technology, teachers face requirements to prepare students for work and life with social robots. Social robots are tested for classroom integration. Teachers' readiness to implement robot lessons depends on their beliefs about social robotic technology's contribution to teaching. Research and development in the field of social robotics still tend to focus more frequently on technology applications rather than pedagogical issues and advancing teaching and learning. What this paper adds Participants refuse to accept the idea of social robot-based instruction. The identified belief pattern is based mainly on the perceived social dimension, intention to use, perceived usability and anxiety. Participants critically perceive the robot's social dimension. Some of PISA's ICT familiarity factors are related to robots acceptability factors. Implication for policy and/or practice The policy and practice need to address how social robots could be integrated into current teaching and learning practices and more importantly how could robotic technology facilitate innovative pedagogical models for effective and efficient learning.

Quantitative research data, through a self-reporting survey drawing on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2), were collected from 520 students in one of the public universities in SA at the start of the first semester of the study year 2023-2024. The findings of structural equation modeling partially supported the UTAUT and previous research in relation to the significant direct effect of performance expectancy (PE), social influence (SI), and effort expectancy (EE) on behavioral intention (BI) on the use of ChatGPT and the significant direct effect of PE, SI, and BI on actual use of ChatGPT. Nonetheless, the results did not support earlier research in relation to the direct relationship between facilitating conditions (FCs) and both BI and actual use of ChatGPT, which was found to be negative in the first relationship and insignificant in the second one. These findings were because of the absence of resources, support, and aid from external sources in relation to the use of ChatGPT. The results showed partial mediation of BI in the link between PE, SI, and FC and actual use of ChatGPT in education and a full mediation in the link of BI between EE and actual use of ChatGPT in education.

REC_06516,Physics instructors' acceptance and implementation of generative AI,"[This paper is part of the Focused Collection in Artificial Intelligence Tools in Physics Teaching and Physics Education Research.] This study investigates physics instructors' acceptance and implementation of generative AI (GenAI) in physics education, guided by Rogers' diffusion of innovation (DOI) theory, focusing on its five-stage innovation-decision process: knowledge, persuasion, decision, implementation, and confirmation. Two survey versions were developed-one for GenAI users and another for nonusers. Data were collected through an online survey featuring five-point Likert scale items and open-ended questions, yielding 320 responses from high school and university physics instructors. The persuasion stage was explored in depth using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). A mixed-method approach combining quantitative structural equation modeling (SEM) and qualitative content analysis was employed. We found instructors distributed across different adoption stages, with key barriers including insufficient technical knowledge (51.75% of nonusers) and language processing limitations (50.5% of users). Hedonic motivation (/3 = 0.498) was found to have a substantially stronger influence on adoption than performance expectancy (/3 = 0.121), with an effect size approximately 4 times greater. We identified significant differences between paid and free GenAI users, with paid users more likely to request prompt-writing guidance (30.56% vs 6.47%) despite using more advanced models. Support needs also varied substantially, as half of paid users requested budget support for GenAI services compared to only 17.65% of free users. Most physics instructors used GenAI primarily for assessment tasks, particularly for generatingphysics problems with solutions. Their primary concerns included incorrect physics information in GenAI responses, potential negative impacts on students' analytical thinking, language barriers, and challenges with prompt writing.

REC_04700,Use of ai-based mental health tools and psychological well-being among Chinese university students: a parallel mediation model of emotional self-efficacy and perceived autonomy,"While AI-powered mental health tools have gained momentum as accessible and user-centered alternatives to traditional services, the psychological processes through which they exert influence remain insufficiently theorized. This gap is especially relevant in contexts such as China, where cultural norms surrounding mental health stigma and reluctance toward emotional disclosure intersect with shifting generational attitudes toward autonomy and self-management. This study aimed to examine the relationship between AI-based mental health tools and psychological well-being among Chinese university students, specifically focusing on the mediating roles of emotional self-efficacy and perceived autonomy in mental health management within a parallel mediation framework. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 3,859 university students across Jiangxi Province, China. Participants completed validated measures assessing use of AI-based mental health tools, emotional self-efficacy, perceived autonomy, and psychological well-being. Structural equation modeling was employed to test a parallel mediation model, controlling for age, gender, academic level, and prior use of mental health apps. A post hoc sensitivity analysis was also conducted to examine the robustness of mediation effects to potential unmeasured confounding. The results showed that using AI-based mental health tools was positively associated with psychological well-being (beta = 0.229, p < 0.001). Both emotional self-efficacy (beta = 0.121, 95% CI: 0.101,0.159) and perceived autonomy in mental health management (beta = 0.132, 95% CI: 0.112,0.176) significantly and partially mediated this association, indicating that the psychological benefits of tool use were transmitted through enhanced emotional regulation and volitional engagement. Bootstrapped indirect effects were statistically significant, with confidence intervals that did not include zero. The overall model explained 38% of the variance in psychological well-being. Sensitivity analysis further demonstrated that the mediation effects were robust to moderate levels of unmeasured confounding. The findings suggest that AI-based mental health tools may enhance student well-being by facilitating symptom management and strengthening emotional self-regulation and volitional engagement in care. These results underscore the importance of autonomy-supportive and empowerment-focused design in digital mental health interventions.

REC_09832,Applying the technology acceptance model to examine factors influencing chatbot use in HPV prevention education among nursing students,"Background Human papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common sexually transmitted infections worldwide. However, its coverage in nursing curricula is often limited. Chatbots offer a novel approach to enhance digital health education, yet their acceptance among nursing students remains underexplored. Objective This study examined nursing students' acceptance and use of an HPV prevention chatbot, based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Methods A cross-sectional study was conducted with 210 nursing students in central Taiwan. Participants engaged with a LINE-based chatbot that included thematic modules, an HPV knowledge assessment, and an expert Q&A. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, t-tests, ANOVA, Pearson correlation, and linear regression. Open-ended feedback was also analyzed. Results Perceived ease of use significantly predicted perceived usefulness (beta = 0.859, p < 0.001). Both predicted attitude (R-2 = 82.2%), which, along with usefulness, predicted behavioral intention (R-2 = 90.8%). Behavioral intention strongly predicted actual use (beta = 0.933, p < 0.001, R-2 = 87.1%).

However, the argument is that its use in education/classroom should be informed by verifiable evidence as well as best practice, which this scholarly work helps build evidence-based research to assess this technology in higher education.Design/methodology/approachPrimary data was collected through structured questionnaire administered online via Google form. Based on the non-probability sampling technique, 300 higher education tutors and students across the UK were purposively targeted, out of which 218 (72.7%) response rate was achieved. Data was analyzed using descriptive statistics with the aid of Statistical Package for Social Sciences, whereby regression, correlation and Chi-square tests were conducted to determine the statistical significance, direction and strength of the relationship between the measured variables.FindingsThis study revealed that AI-generated learning materials support active learning strategies that enable students to actively engage in their learning, likewise enabling students to develop deeper understanding of their course content with significantly better knowledge retention, which is critical to the learning process. However, findings further revealed that acceptance/regular use of AI-generated learning materials is still below par across the higher education institutions, and there is major concern that the benefits may not be fully realized due to barriers to adoption.Research limitations/implicationsThere are limitations that future studies can improve on, especially in terms of methodology.

By applying the technology acceptance model (TAM), it explores how perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitudes and behavioral intentions influence students' academic outcomes. With the increasing integration of AI in education, understanding its impact on student performance is crucial for universities to develop informed strategies. This study also examines the extent and patterns of AI tool usage, such as ChatGPT, Grammarly and Quillbot, providing insights into which tools are most commonly used and why.Design/methodology/approachA quantitative research design was employed using a structured survey distributed to 377 undergraduate students who use AI tools for academic purposes. This study used convenience sampling due to accessibility constraints and analyzed the data using Statistical Package for Social Sciences. Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were applied to examine relationships between four independent variables; perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude, behavioral intention and academic performance. Reliability of the constructs was confirmed through Cronbach's alpha, all exceeding 0.87. The methodology aimed to identify significant factors influencing AI adoption and their correlation with improved academic outcomes.FindingsThe findings indicate that all four independent variables; perceived usefulness, ease of use, attitude and behavioral intention positively correlate with academic performance. Among them, perceived ease of use had the strongest correlation, followed by perceived usefulness. Attitudes and behavioral intentions showed moderate but significant relationships. ChatGPT and Grammarly were the most frequently used AI tools due to their accessibility and relevance to academic tasks.

Malaysia is among the countries forging ahead with the Fourth Industrial Revolution. One of the core technologies mentioned is adopting artificial intelligence tools such as chatbots. In the last few years, there has been a growing interest in AI-based chatbot adoption in the non-HEI context. However, most higher-education institutions (HEIs) are reported not ready to adopt AI-based chatbots as one of the solutions for virtual student services support. The research of chatbot adoption in the HEI context is still new and is a less explored and examined topic in the information systems domain. Moreover, most of the existing research regarding chatbot adoption in the HEI context focuses more on the benefit of chatbot usage and is not specialised in a student services solution perspective. Furthermore, most of the studies were not guided by the information systems (IS) theories.

REC_08196,Factors Influencing University Students' Behavioural Intention to Use Generative Artificial Intelligence for Educational Purposes Based on a Revised UTAUT2 Model,"BackgroundGenerative artificial intelligence (AI) represents a significant technological leap, with platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT and Baidu's Ernie Bot at the forefront of innovation. This technology has seen widespread adoption across various sectors of society and is anticipated to revolutionise the educational landscape, especially in the domain of tertiary education. However, there is a gap in understanding factors influencing university students' behavioural intention to use generative AI, leading to hesitation in its adoption.ObjectivesThe primary objective of this study was to investigate the factors that influence university students' behavioural intention to engage with and utilise generative AI. The study sought to delve into the fundamental reasons and obstacles that university students encounter when contemplating the adoption of this technology for their academic endeavours.MethodsThe study used a quantitative research design, utilising a revised version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model. Data were collected from a sample of 380 university students in Changsha, the capital city of Hunan in China. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyse the relationships between the variables of the model, which included performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), social influence (SI), facilitating conditions (FC), learning value, habit and behavioural intention.ResultsThe analysis revealed that PE and EE have a direct impact on learning value. Additionally, SI and FC were found to directly affect the formation of habit. Among these factors, learning value emerged as the most potent predictor of university students' behavioural intention to use generative AI. Habit also demonstrated a significant, albeit smaller, effect on behavioural intention.ConclusionsThe study's findings underscore the importance of learning value in driving the adoption of generative AI among university students. Efforts to enhance the learning value of generative AI could significantly increase its uptake in higher education. Furthermore, the role of habit, while less pronounced, suggests that consistent exposure and use can foster a greater inclination towards generative AI. These insights provide a foundation for targeted interventions aimed at improving the integration and application of generative AI within educational settings. Stakeholders, including educators, policymakers and designers of generative AI, can leverage these findings to create an environment conducive to the adoption and effective use of generative AI in higher education.",2024,WoS; Scopus,include,uncertain,0.97,0.0,,,"This is a quantitative empirical study (PLS-SEM) with primary data from 380 university students, focused specifically on generative AI adoption in higher education.

REC_04748,Factors influencing the acceptance and use of ChatGPT among English as a foreign language learners in Saudi Arabia,"With accelerating advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, which have provided new possibilities for language learning and teaching, this study explored the factors influencing the use of a popular AI tool, ChatGPT, for English language learning among post-secondary students in Saudi Arabia. A technology acceptance model (TAM) questionnaire was administered, which yielded 184 responses (31 males, and 153 females). The results revealed that the perceived ease of use and usefulness significantly affected ChatGPT adoption. However, no significant relationship was found between perceived ease of use and attitudes, suggesting that learners' attitudes were influenced more by the tool's benefits and value for language learning. A strong positive relationship was found between Perceived Usefulness (PU) and Attitude (AT), indicating that when learners perceive ChatGPT as useful, they have favourable attitudes toward it. Educators should emphasize these benefits and integrate ChatGPT into English as a foreign language (EFL) classroom to enhance language skills. A positive attitude toward ChatGPT leads to stronger behavioural intention to use it, which positively predicts actual use. Other factors, such as gender, education level, duration of usage, and IT skills, were also examined. The results showed that female respondents had more positive attitudes; master's students perceived it as easier to use than diploma students; and longer usage durations were linked to a higher perceived ease of use.

REC_12745,Investigation of Theology Undergraduate Students' Behavioral Intention to Use Chatbot in Religious Education in Terms of Different Variables,"This study aims to determine the behavioral intentions of students studying religious education in higher education to learn and use chatbot technologies that provide services in online environments. Chatbots are artificial intelligence chat robots that can be used with devices such as computers, tablets, and phones that provide access to the internet, offer voice and text communication capabilities, and generate responses by retrieving information from a wide range of sources in a virtual environment. These software programs are preferred because they can generate responses to questions within seconds and provide results that would otherwise require lengthy searches across multiple pages via search engines in a short amount of time. However, chatbots may occasionally provide incorrect information due to the nature of content creation in virtual environments and the presence of both accurate and inaccurate information on online platforms. This situation necessitates careful consideration when using chatbots in individual education and requires that the information obtained be verified from reliable sources. Research on using chatbots as a supportive tool for learning in religious education is still limited. Given the rapid advancement of technological capabilities in this era and their contributions to complex, challenging, and longterm processes such as education and the potential contributions they may offer in the future, conducting such studies is of great importance. The faculties of theology are divided into different disciplines based on the structure of the field, each of which is equally valuable and has a rich curriculum, thus requiring intensive access to resources. It is necessary to examine whether chatbot applications are preferred in faculties of theology due to their advantages in terms of facilitating access to information and providing temporal and economic benefits. While there are limited studies on the use of chatbots in religious education in the literature, there are relatively more studies on using artificial intelligence in religious education in general. However, there are no studies on using chatbots to support the learning of those studying religious education in Turkey. This study is important in terms of providing a source for future research on the integration of rapidly developing technology into the field of religious education and serving as a starting point. The research was conducted on 261 students enrolled at the Faculty of Theology at Akdeniz University during the spring semester of the 2024-2025 academic year. A descriptive model of a general survey type was used in the research. To reveal the behavioral intentions of the working group to learn about chatbot technologies and use them in education, the Chatbot Use and Learning Behavioral Intentions Scale developed by Mokmin and Ibrahim and adapted into Turkish by Durak and Onan was used with the Personal Information Form. The scale consists of 8 sub-dimensions and 24 items to determine students' various attitudes and expectations regarding chatbot use. The study results showed that participants' effort and performance expectations were high, and their attitudes toward learning development and self-efficacy levels were also positive. The averages for social influence and facilitating conditions were moderate. Participants' anxiety levels regarding chatbot use were generally low. Additionally, it was determined that participants' behavioral intention subscale scores regarding using chatbots in education/learning did not differ significantly by gender. However, previous studies have shown that male students are more enthusiastic. It was determined that some of the participants' subscale scores differed according to the class level variable. According to the multiple comparison test results, the averages of 4th-grade students in terms of improving learning, social impact, and facilitating conditions are higher. This can be interpreted as familiarity with and awareness of technology increasing as the class progresses. Only a significant difference in the facilitating conditions subscale regarding the mother's education level was found. Students with mothers who are middle school graduates appear to have an advantage. A significant difference was found in the learning development and facilitating conditions subscales regarding the father's education level. Accordingly, student attitudes are positively affected as the father's education level increases. A significant difference was found only in the facilitating conditions subscale dimension in the individual income variable. The fact that high-income students have better technological equipment explains this difference. No significant difference was found in any subscale dimension related to the type of high school the participants graduated from. However, the high number of imam-hatip high school graduates in the sample may have influenced this result. In general, it can be said that theology faculty undergraduate students have a positive attitude toward chatbot technologies and are inclined to use them more widely in the future. Although demographic differences are effective in some areas, it can be said that students accept the potential of chatbots in education.",2025,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.57,,,codex timed out after 300s,"Codex-sub(gpt-5.1-codex-mini): Quantitative survey (261 theology undergraduates) measuring behavioral intentions to use chatbot (AI) in education with statistical comparisons, satisfying inclusion criteria.",include,oauth,retry_gemini-2.5-flash,,,,,,,T3_dual_ai,,,HIGH,include_confirm

This paper investigates the influences of AI educators' autonomy design on students' usage intentions by delving into how the artificial autonomy of AI educators satisfies students' needs. Drawing on the uses and gratification (U&G) framework, we theoretically elaborate on how AI educator autonomy (i.e., sensing autonomy, thought autonomy, and action autonomy) influences students' intentions to use an AI educator through the mediating effects of U&G benefits (i.e., information-seeking gratification, social interaction gratification, and entertainment gratification). By conducting an online survey (N = 673) on college students, we found that the sensing autonomy of AI educators is positively associated with usage intention due to the mediating effects of social interaction and entertainment gratifications; the thought autonomy of AI educators is positively related to usage intention, mediated by information-seeking and social interaction gratifications, and the action autonomy of AI educators is positively linked with usage intention through the paths of information-seeking and entertainment gratifications.

REC_14089,The Use of AI-Driven Automation to Enhance Student Learning Experiences in the KSA: An Alternative Pathway to Sustainable Education,"The relevance of virtual learning platforms has been increasingly recognised, and their merit in contributing to sustainable education is ever growing. Depending on the context, the benefits of these virtual platforms were revealed during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, their impact has lingered on post-COVID-19, and virtual learning is now considered a viable option for continuing and sustainable education. Therefore, many countries have taken advantage of these virtual platforms to maximise student engagement, as evidenced by the reports in the existing literature. However, while these studies have explored how this can best be achieved, there are very few studies which have examined how the use of virtual platforms can help to deliver an educational approach that prepares young people to address the many and complex sustainability challenges of the future, i.e., the delivery of sustainable education. This study addresses this gap in the literature by exploring the question of how AI-powered automation can enhance student learning experiences in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (hereafter, KSA) as an alternative pathway for sustainable education. Data were collected from 1991 undergraduate and postgraduate students across 10 different Saudi universities using an online survey. The data were analysed using advanced structural equation modelling (SEM) to examine the relationship between student readiness and the (AI-powered) automation of administrative processes. The findings highlight the transformative potential of AI as an alternative pathway to sustainable education and for streamlining learning management system (LMS) operations. The implications of this study extend beyond the immediate instructional context, offering strategic direction for educators, LMS designers, policymakers, and institutional leaders in harnessing AI to equip individuals with the knowledge, skills, values, and attitudes necessary to contribute to a sustainable future.",2024,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.79,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12065,Exploring factors influencing Contrimetric adoption and word-ofmouth advocacy in academic libraries,"Contrimetric is an AI-powered bibliometric plugin designed to provide real-time citation tracking, personalised content recommendations, reference validation, and dynamic research impact dashboards. This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of Contrimetric, an emerging AI-powered bibliometric tool, in academic libraries across China. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), the research examines how perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, social influence, and facilitating conditions affect behavioural intention, which in turn drives word-of-mouth (WOM) advocacy among academic peers. Data were collected through a structured survey administered to librarians and researchers in Chinese universities, yielding 400 valid responses representing diverse academic disciplines and institutional settings. The results confirm that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, social influence, and facilitating conditions all have significant positive effects on behavioural intention, and behavioural intention positively influences WOM. Mediation analysis further indicates that behavioural intention mediates the relationships between perceived usefulness, social influence, facilitating conditions, and WOM, while the indirect path for perceived ease of use is marginally significant at the 10% level. These findings highlight the critical role of institutional support and peer influence in fostering advocacy, such as recommending Contrimetric to colleagues and encouraging its adoption in academic environments. The study contributes to the technology adoption literature by extending TAM and UTAUT beyond initial adoption, incorporating post-adoption WOM behaviours as a critical outcome, and offers practical implications for policymakers and library administrators seeking to enhance research visibility through AI-enabled services.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.92,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07052,How effort expectancy and performance expectancy interact to trigger higher education students' uses of ChatGPT for learning,"PurposeThe emergence of artificial intelligence technologies, like ChatGPT, has taken the world by storm, particularly in the education sector. This study aims to adopt the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology to explore how effort expectancy (EEC) and performance expectancy (PEE) individually, jointly, congruently and incongruently affect higher education students' intentions and actual uses of ChatGPT for their learning.Design/methodology/approachAn advanced methodology - polynomial regression with response surface analysis - and a sample of 1,461 higher education students recruited in Vietnam through three-phase stratified random sampling approach were adopted to test developed hypotheses.FindingsBoth EEC and PEE were found to have a direct positive impact on the likelihood of higher education students' intention to use ChatGPT, which in turn promotes them actually use this tool for learning purposes. Conversely, a large incongruence between EEC and PEE will lower the level of intentions and actual uses of ChatGPT for learning. However, when there is a growing incongruence between EEC and PEE, either in a positive or negative direction, the likelihood of students' intentions to use ChatGPT for learning decreases.Practical implicationsSome practical implications are subsequently recommended to obtain advantages and address potential threats arising from the implementation of this novel technology in the education context.Originality/valueThis study shed the new light on the educational setting by testing how higher education students' intentions to use ChatGPT and subsequent actual uses of ChatGPT are synthesized from the balance between high EEC and PEE.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.89,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14106,University Students' Usage of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Sustainability: A Cross-Sectional Survey from China,"The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology has triggered extensive discussions about its potential applications in sustainable higher education. Based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and task-technology fit (TTF) theory, this research aimed to investigate the current situations and challenges of Chinese university students using GenAI in four typical task scenarios. This was performed using a cross-sectional research design. The data were collected via questionnaire, with 486 undergraduates from a Chinese university participating. The data analysis methods include descriptive statistics, inferential statistics, and content analysis. The results show that more than 70% of university students actively use GenAI, but nearly half of them are not very proficient in its use. Doubao and ERNIE Bot are the GenAI tools they prefer most. The primary functions they use are text production and information retrieval. They mainly learn the relevant knowledge and skills through self-media and knowledge-sharing platforms. Among the four typical task scenarios, GenAI is widely used in course learning and research activities, while its application in daily life and job search is relatively limited. The analysis of demographic variables shows that grade and major have a significant impact on university students' use of GenAI. In addition, university students suggest that universities should offer relevant courses or lectures and provide comprehensive technical support to improve the popularity and operability of GenAI. This study provides suggestions for universities, education administration departments, and technology development departments to improve GenAI services.

REC_02756,Patients' Acceptance and Intentions on Using Artificial Intelligence in Dental Diagnosis: Insights From Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 Model,"Introduction and aims: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming dental care by enhancing diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and patient experience. This study aimed to assess dental patients' acceptance, perceptions, and concerns regarding AI-powered diagnosis using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) framework through structural equation modelling (SEM). Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among dental patients at King Saud University Dental Hospital, Riyadh. Data were collected using a structured questionnaire based on the UTAUT2 framework. Confirmatory factor analysis was performed to assess the validity and reliability of the measurement model. SEM was then utilized to evaluate the relationships between UTAUT2 constructs and patients' behavioural intention toward AIpowered dental diagnosis. Results: A total of 505 participants responded to the questionnaire. SEM indicated a strong model fit (GFI = 0.900, Comparative Fit Index = 0.906, Tucker-Lewis Index = 0.907, root mean square error of approximation = 0.083). Performance expectancy (/3 = 0.32, P < .001), social influence (/3 = 0.56, P < .001), and facilitating conditions (/3 = 0.34, P <.001) significantly predicted behavioural intention. The model explained 68.1% of the variance (R2 = 0.681), highlighting key drivers of AI adoption. While 60% of participants trusted AI dental diagnosis, 55% expressed concerns about data privacy and accuracy. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that performance expectancy, social influence, and facilitating conditions are key factors influencing the acceptance of AI in dental diagnosis. Addressing these factors can help develop user-friendly AI tools in dentistry, thereby improving adoption. Future research should focus on clear communication about AI and patient education to alleviate concerns and promote equitable and widespread use. Clinical relevance:Acceptance of AI in dentistry depends on performance, motivation, andtrust. Understanding these factors can guide the user-centred development of AI technolo-gies, enhancing their integration into diagnostics and improving patient outcomes.& Oacute;2025 The Authors.

REC_02767,Empowering ChatGPT adoption in higher education: A comprehensive analysis of university students' intention to adopt artificial intelligence using self-determination and technology-to-performance chain theories,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI), particularly ChatGPT, in higher education is rapidly expanding, offering new avenues for enhancing the learning experience. Despite its potential, the adoption of ChatGPT remains in need of further study, especially in regions like Saudi Arabia. Previous studies have focused on general e-learning tools, but more research needs to examine the specific factors influencing university students' adoption of AI technologies. This study aims to investigate the adoption of ChatGPT among university students in Saudi Arabia, focusing on the mediating role of Technology-to-Performance Chain (TPC) theory between SelfDetermination Theory (SDT) constructs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and students' intentions to adopt ChatGPT. It also seeks to identify which SDT factors most significantly affect the adoption process. Using a quantitative approach, this study collected data from 253 university students in Saudi Arabia. Structural equation modelling was used to analyze the collected data and determine the relationship between self-determination theory (SDT), technology-to-performance chain theory (TPC) and ChatGPT adoption. Findings reveal that the perceived autonomy and relatedness significantly affect TTF and ChatGPT utilisation, whereas perceived competence has no effect. In addition, TTF and utilisation are the main predictors of intention to adopt ChatGPT. These findings can be useful for educational policy makers and researchers because they indicate that to enhance university students' adoption of AI technologies, focus should be given to their psychological needs. The results also show that enhancing students' self-determination and their perceived connection with technology can significantly affect their decision to adopt such technologies. This research also presents a new model wherein SDT is integrated with TPC with regard to AI in higher education, specifically in the context of Saudi Arabia.

REC_13252,Factors influencing acceptance and trust of chatbots in juvenile offenders' risk assessment training,"IntroductionResearch has identified simulation-based training with chatbots and virtual avatars as an effective educational strategy in some domains, such as medicine and mental health disciplines. Several studies on interactive systems have also suggested that user experience is decisive for adoption. As interest increases, it becomes important to examine the factors influencing user acceptance and trust in simulation-based training systems, and to validate applicability to specific learning tasks. The aim of this research is twofold: (1) to examine the perceived acceptance and trust in a risk assessment training chatbot developed to help students assess risk and needs of juvenile offenders, and (2) to examine the factors influencing students' perceptions of acceptance and trust. MethodsParticipants were 112 criminology students in an undergraduate course in a Canadian university. Participants were directed to use a custom-designed chatbot with a virtual 3D avatar for juvenile offenders' risk assessment training, to complete online questionnaires and a risk assessment exercise. ResultsResults show satisfactory levels of acceptance and trust in the chatbot. Concerning acceptance, more than half appeared to be satisfied or very satisfied with the chatbot, while most participants appeared to be neutral or satisfied with the benevolence and credibility of the chatbot. DiscussionResults suggest that acceptance and trust do not only depend on the design of the chatbot software, but also on the characteristics of the user, and most prominently on self-efficacy, state anxiety, learning styles and neuroticism personality traits.

REC_14116,Relative Advantage and Compatibility as Drivers of ChatGPT Adoption in Latin American Higher Education: A PLS SEM Study Towards Sustainable Digital Education,"As Latin American universities pursue digitally and environmentally sustainable teaching models, understanding why students adopt generative AI is essential. We analyzed data from undergraduate students (n = 792) across five Latin American countries (Peru, Chile, Bolivia, Argentina, and Colombia). Grounded in the diffusion of innovations theory, the study evaluated the effects of relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability on attitudes towards ChatGPT and examined the effect of attitude on intention to use among higher education students in the region. The reliability and validity of the measurement scale were confirmed, and structural relationships were tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The model explained 58.1% of the variance in attitude: relative advantage (beta = 0.247) and compatibility (beta = 0.246) exerted the largest effects, followed by trialability (beta = 0.223) and observability (beta = 0.167); complexity showed a weaker yet significant effect (beta = 0.118). Attitude strongly predicted the intention to use ChatGPT (beta = 0.777), accounting for 60.4% of its variance. All paths were significant (p < 0.001), and psychometric indicators exceeded recommended thresholds. These findings indicate that student adoption is driven more by perceived academic benefits and alignment with existing learning routines than by technical ease.

REC_07099,Understanding AI acceptance among Indonesian pre-service teachers: the mediating role of anxiety and self-efficacy in a UTAUT framework,"PurposeThis study aims to analyze the psychological factors that influence the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) technology among pre-service teachers in Indonesia. This study develops the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) model by adding the constructs of self-efficacy and technology anxiety to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the intention to use AI in the context of higher education.Design/methodology/approachThis study used a quantitative explanatory approach with a cross-sectional survey design. Data were collected from 1,260 pre-service teachers in teacher education faculty through an online questionnaire and analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique to test the relationship between latent variables and the overall predictive power of the model.FindingsThe results indicated that perceived usefulness and attitude toward use significantly influenced behavioral intention to use AI. Self-efficacy increased perceived usefulness and ease of use, while anxiety decreased intention indirectly. This model provides empirical support for the development of UTAUT theory in the context of education in developing countries.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation of this study is the cross-sectional design that is unable to capture the dynamics of attitude change over time. The implications of the study suggest the need for longitudinal studies and mixed approaches to better understand the contextual process of technology adoption in pre-service teacher's education settings.Practical implicationsThe results of this study can be used as a basis for developing pre-service teachers that not only focuses on technical skills but also builds digital self-efficacy and reduces technology anxiety. Higher education institutions are advised to design contextual learning programs and policy support that encourage sustainable AI integration.Originality/valueThis study provides an original contribution through the integration of psychological factors into the UTAUT model and focuses on the population of pre-service teachers in Indonesia. This study highlights the importance of the affective dimension in driving readiness for technology adoption and offers a conceptual model that is relevant to the educational context in developing countries.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.85,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13282,University teachers' beliefs about the use of generative artificial intelligence for teaching and learning,"Introduction: The growing presence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in our society, particularly in the educational field, is undeniable. This fact has led to various studies on its implications for learning and teaching. However, as with other technological resources, these implications will depend on how teachers use GenAI. Therefore, it is essential to identify teachers' beliefs regarding the use of GenAI for teaching and learning. Methods: To this end, a questionnaire was designed and completed by 321 university teachers. This questionnaire consisted of two parts. The first included questions about the participants' demographic information and a Likert scale on teachers' pedagogical beliefs. The second part consisted of a 32-item Likert scale that evaluated teachers' beliefs about the impact of GenAI on their students' learning and their own teaching. These aspects were reflected through items that considered GenAI as either an educational opportunity or a threat. Results: The results showed that, of all the variables analyzed, only pedagogical beliefs and the frequency of previous GenAI use influenced beliefs about GenAI usage. Specifically, teachers with constructivist beliefs saw greater potential in GenAI compared to others. Similarly, teachers who regularly used these technologies had more positive beliefs about their educational use than those who used them sporadically or not at all. Lastly, it was also observed that while teachers valued the positive effects of GenAI on their teaching work, they also considered that its use could be detrimental to the learning processes of their students, making them more superficial. Discussion: These findings underline the importance of providing teachers with training focused on constructive approaches that enable them to maximize the potential of GenAI in education. In particular, it is crucial to promote teaching practices that, through student-centered GenAI use, foster active and reflective processes in students, aligned with the competencies demanded by today's society.",2024,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.73,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13284,Mediating effects of artificial intelligence on the relationship between academic engagement and mental health among Chinese college students,"Introduction: Academic engagement of Chinese college students has received increasing research attention due to its impact on Students' Mental health and wellbeing. The emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies marked the beginning of a new era in education, offering innovative tools and approaches to enhance learning. Still, it can be viewed from positive and negative perspectives. This study utilizes the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) as a theoretical framework to analyze the mediating role of students' attitudes toward AI, perceived social norms, perceived behavioral control, and their intention to use AI technologies in the relationships between Students' academic engagement and Mental health. Methods: The study involved a total of 2,423 Chinese college students with a mean age of approximately 20.531.51 years. The survey was conducted through Questionnaire Star, using a secure website designed specifically for the study. The Hayes' PROCESS Macro (Version 4.2) Model 80 with SPSS 29.0, a multivariate regression analysis with a chain mediation model that allows for multiple mediators to be tested sequentially, has been used. The statistical test explored the direct and indirect effects of students' engagement (X) on mental health (Y) through a series of mediators: attitude toward AI (M1), subjective norm (M2), perceived behavioral control over AI use (M3), and AI use behavioral intention (M4). Results: The direct positive relationship between engagement and mental health (beta=0.0575; p<0.05), as well as identifying key mediating factors such as perceived behavioral control (beta=0.1039; p<0.05) and AI use of behavioral intention (beta=0.0672; p<0.05), highlights the potential of AI tools in enhancing students' well-being. However, the non-significant mediating effects of attitude toward AI (beta=0.0135), and subjective norms (beta=-0.0005), suggest that more research is needed to understand the nuances of these relationships fully. Discussion: Overall, the study contributes to the growing body of literature on the role of AI in education and offers practical implications for improving mental health support in academic settings.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.51,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13302,The human touch in AI: optimizing language learning through self-determination theory and teacher scaffolding,"Introduction Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming language education, yet its long-term impact on motivation and proficiency, particularly how AI-driven gamification and teacher scaffolding interact in culturally distinct EFL contexts, remains underexplored. This study investigates the sustained influence of AI-powered language games on Chinese EFL learners' motivation, engagement, and English proficiency.Methods This mixed-methods, longitudinal quasi-experimental study involved 150 intermediate Chinese EFL learners across three universities. Participants were stratified into three groups: AI with teacher scaffolding, AI only, and a control group using non-AI gamified platforms. Over 16 weeks, we collected quantitative data (IELTS Indicator tests, motivation and technology acceptance surveys) and qualitative data (interviews, observations, and reflective journals).Results Quantitative analyses revealed that the AI with Scaffolding group achieved significantly greater and more sustained proficiency gains than both the AI Only and Control groups. Motivation was significantly mediated by the satisfaction of Self-Determination Theory needs. Qualitative findings highlighted teacher scaffolding's pivotal role in contextualizing AI feedback, mitigating algorithmic rigidity, and fostering a novice-to-self-regulated learner trajectory. Cultural factors significantly influenced technology acceptance.Discussion Findings underscore that AI's potential in language learning is maximized when strategically integrated with human pedagogical expertise, which addresses AI's limitations related to cultural nuances, overcorrection, and trust. This study offers concrete practical implications for educators and institutions, advocating for a balanced, human-centered approach to AI integration in diverse EFL contexts.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.72,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14137,Exploring the Key Factors Influencing College Students' Willingness to Use AI Coding Assistant Tools: An Expanded Technology Acceptance Model,"The application of artificial intelligence (AI) in programming assistance has garnered researchers' attention for its potential to reduce learning costs for users, increase work efficiency, and decrease repetitive coding tasks. However, given the novelty of AI Coding Assistant Tools (AICATs), user acceptance is currently limited, and the factors influencing this phenomenon are unclear. This study proposes an expanded model based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that incorporates the characteristics of AICAT users to explore the key factors affecting college students' willingness to use AICATs. Utilizing a survey methodology, 303 Chinese participants completed the questionnaire. Factor analysis and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results indicate that users' dependence worry (DW) about AICATs positively affects perceived risk (PR), which in turn negatively impacts perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEOU), thus reducing user willingness to use. Dependence concerns also negatively impact perceived trust (PT), while PT positively affects PU and PEOU, thereby enhancing willingness to use. Additionally, a user's self-efficacy (SE) negatively impacts DW and positively affects PEOU. This study discusses the potential significance of these findings and offers suggestions for AICAT developers to foster and promote widespread use.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13316,Research on the influencing factors of generative artificial intelligence usage intent in post-secondary education: an empirical analysis based on the AIDUA extended model,"Objective Generative Artificial Intelligence (AIGC) presents a profound dialectic in higher education: its transformative potential is challenged by deep-seated psychological and ethical barriers. Traditional adoption models fail to capture this complexity. To bridge this gap, this study develops and tests an integrated cognitive-behavioral framework. We posit that AIGC acceptance is a three-stage cognitive appraisal process. By embedding an extended AIDUA model-a framework specifically tailored to the unique challenges of AI adoption-within Cognitive Appraisal Theory, we investigate how novel antecedent dimensions (Socio-Ethical: ethical risk, explainability; Techno-Performance: generation quality, context-awareness) and classical factors (social influence, hedonic motivation, anthropomorphism) shape core technological beliefs (Performance & Effort Expectancy), which in turn mediate the path to acceptance intention via emotion. Furthermore, the moderating roles of gender, academic background, ethnicity, and political affiliation are systematically examined to test the model's boundary conditions.Methods The model was empirically validated using Structural Equation Modeling and multi-group analysis on survey data from 462 university students across 15 diverse institutions in China.Results The findings reveal that the cognitive appraisal of AIGC is primarily driven by its perceived capabilities and safety. Techno-Performance (generation quality, beta = 0.53) and Socio-Ethical (explainability, beta = 0.41; ethical risk, beta = -0.25) dimensions were the most powerful predictors of Performance Expectancy. These intrinsic appraisals significantly outweighed the influence of external social cues. Notably, ethical risk perception operated as a dual-threat, not only lowering performance expectations but also significantly amplifying the perceived cognitive burden (Effort Expectancy, beta = 0.33). Multi-group analyses confirmed that these appraisal pathways are systematically moderated by individual and cultural background variables, highlighting significant heterogeneity in user responses.Discussion This study makes a critical theoretical contribution by demonstrating how core technological expectancies are formed through a multi-stage appraisal of utility, ethics, and experience, moving beyond mere identification of influential factors. The findings dismantle the myth of a universal student user, revealing that AIGC adoption is a culturally and contextually embedded process. Practically, the results provide an evidence-based roadmap for university policymakers and AIGC developers, emphasizing that fostering trust and adoption requires a dual focus: maximizing technological prowess while actively mitigating perceived ethical and cognitive costs through enhanced transparency and user-centric design.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Employing a convenience sampling strategy, 387 university students from China were included in the study. Methodologically, we employed structural equation modeling (SEM) for the measurement and causal analysis, and we employed fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) for the configurational analysis. The research results emphasize several important insights. Perceived usefulness, intrinsic motivation, and satisfaction play important roles in encouraging university students' continuance intentions. Satisfaction emerges as a pivotal mediator, bridging the connection between perceived usefulness, intrinsic motivation, and continuance intention. The system quality, the information quality, and social interaction have significant positive influences on perceived usefulness. Perceived autonomy and perceived competence display strong correlations with both intrinsic motivation and satisfaction. Moreover, the results from the fsQCA show five configurations, in which the key factors collectively shape students' continuance intentions through complex interactions through various configurations. The findings reveal diverse configurations by which university students form continuance intentions towards using AI tools for SDL, providing detailed insights into the profound and indirect impacts on forming continuance intention behaviors.

REC_13556,Prediction of the Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Through ChatGPT Among Costa Rican University Students: A PLS Model Based on UTAUT2,"The rise in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) is transforming education, with tools like ChatGPT enhancing learning, content creation, and academic support. This study analyzes ChatGPT's acceptance among Costa Rican university students using the UTAUT2 model and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The research examines key predictors of AI adoption, including performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, behavioral intention, and actual usage. The findings from 194 students indicate that performance expectancy (beta = 0.596, p < 0.001) is the strongest predictor of behavioral intention, followed by effort expectancy (beta = 0.241, p = 0.005), while social influence (beta = 0.381, p < 0.001) and facilitating conditions (beta = 0.217, p = 0.008) play a smaller role. Behavioral intention significantly influences actual usage (beta = 0.643, p < 0.001). Gender and age differences emerge, with male students and those aged 21-30 years showing higher acceptance levels. Despite positive attitudes toward ChatGPT, the students report insufficient training for effective use, underscoring the need for AI literacy programs and structured pedagogical strategies. This study calls for further research on AI training programs and their long-term impact on academic performance to foster responsible GenAI adoption in higher education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00778,Development and validation of the perceived interactivity of learner-AI interaction scale,"As learners are able to perceive interactivity when interacting with instructors or peer learners in traditional learning environments, learners are similarly able to perceive interactivity when interacting with artificial intelligence (AI) in AI-supported learning environments. Advancements in AI, such as generative AI including ChatGPT and Midjourney, enhance learners' perceived interactivity, thereby facilitating learning through AI-enabled interaction. However, there is no scale in education for measuring perceived interactivity of learner-AI interaction. This study develops a 17-item scale to assess the extent to which a learner perceives interactivity with AI from four dimensions: responsiveness, personalization, learner control, and learning engagement. The sample group included 422 Chinese university students for the first application and 306 university students for the second application. Both the exploratory factor analysis and the confirmatory factor analysis verified the factor structure of the scale. The Cronbach's alpha value for the whole scale was 0.948, whereas the Cronbach's alpha values for the four dimensions ranged between 0.820 and 0.915. Results suggested that this scale was a reliable and valid instrument. This study also found that perceived interactivity of learner-AI interaction was significantly associated with AI tools, learners' behavioral intentions to use AI in learning, months of using AI in learning, and average duration of using AI in learning each time, and not associated with ages, genders, education levels, and fields of education.

REC_00781,Lessons learned from designing an open-source automated feedback system for STEM education,"As distance learning becomes increasingly important and artificial intelligence tools continue to advance, automated systems for individual learning have attracted significant attention. However, the scarcity of open-source online tools that are capable of providing personalized feedback has restricted the widespread implementation of research-based feedback systems. In this work, we present RATsApp, an open-source automated feedback system (AFS) that incorporates research-based features such as formative feedback. The system focuses on core STEM competencies such as mathematical competence, representational competence, and data literacy. It also allows lecturers to monitor students' progress. RATsApp can be used at different levels of STEM education or research, as it allows the creation and customization of the educational content. We present a specific case of its implementation in higher education, where we report the results of a usability survey (N=64), using the technology acceptance model 2 (TAM2), to evaluate the user experience of undergraduate students. Our findings confirm the applicability of the TAM2 framework, revealing that factors such as the relevance to the course of study, output quality, and ease of use significantly influence the perceived usefulness. We also found a linear relation between the perceived usefulness and the intention to use, which in turn is a significant predictor of the frequency of use. Moreover, the formative feedback feature of RATsApp received positive feedback, indicating its potential as an educational tool. Furthermore, as an open-source platform, RATsApp encourages public contributions to its ongoing development, fostering a collaborative approach to improve educational tools.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.91,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14427,Exploring the Impact of Artificial Intelligence on University Students’ Perception of Slow Employment: A Psychological and Behavioral Analysis,"This study explores the psychological effects of artificial intelligence (AI) tools on university students’ perceptions and experiences of slow employment. The aim is to understand how the use of AI tools influences students’ anxiety, stress, motivation, and decision-making confidence, as well as their coping strategies in the context of job search challenges. Using a mixed-methods approach, data were collected through quantitative surveys (n = 200) and qualitative interviews (n = 10), followed by behavioral and emotional analysis using AI-based sentiment and emotion recognition systems. Moreover, for quantitative data, regression analysis was performed to identify the factors that impacted the students’ psychological well-being. In contrast, for qualitative data, thematic analysis was employed to identify the psychological and emotional outcomes associated with slow employment. The findings show that AI tool usage significantly reduced anxiety, increased confidence, and enhanced students’ self-efficacy and motivation, while stress remained positively correlated with anxiety levels. The emotional analysis revealed dynamic shifts in emotional states, with anxiety decreasing and confidence increasing after the AI interaction. The study concludes that AI tools offer significant psychological support but require refinement in terms of personalization and transparency. The integration of AI tools with human support systems is essential for practical career guidance.

REC_00807,Exploring the adoption of AI-enabled English learning applications among university students using extended UTAUT2 model,"The rapid growth of technology has penetrated the realm of education, reshaping old teaching philosophies and improving educational approaches. Notably, the influence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on English learning has become momentous. However, a critical issue is the lack of autonomy in AI-enabled English learning applications, leading to lower engagement of students. The study investigates students' adoption intention and usage behavior to embrace AI-enabled English learning applications in China. Leveraging the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model, extended with Perceived Enjoyment and Personal Innovativeness, this study provides a nuanced understanding of student adoption through delving into the applications' attractiveness and users' inherent tendencies toward technology adoption. Data from 1167 undergraduate students at Shandong University were collected using an online survey with simple random sampling and analyzed through the partial least square-structure equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results highlight the positive influence of performance expectancy (beta = 0.294), perceived enjoyment (beta = 0.186), personal innovativeness (beta = 0.341), and price value (beta = 0.159) on adopting AI-enabled English learning applications, accentuating that students with a greater propensity for exploring new technologies are more likely to adopt these applications. However, mediating effect analysis indicates that only performance expectancy (beta = 0.075), personal innovativeness (beta = 0.087), and perceived enjoyment (beta = 0.048) significantly influence usage behavior through adoption intention, suggesting the primacy of innovative features and engaging content in the applications. This study provides a theoretical expansion of UTAUT2, leading to a refined and education focused version of UTAUT2. Future research is suggested to involve gender and frequency of app usage into the study, and conduct longitudinal studies to scrutinize the long-term impact and sustainability of AI-enabled learning applications.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.44,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13617,The Double-Edged Sword Effect of Interaction Frequency with AI on College Students: The Moderating Role of Peer Support,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has become an indispensable resource in contemporary higher education, providing substantial benefits to both students and institutions. As its adoption accelerates, it is important to balance these advantages against potential risks that may arise from students’ varying levels of interaction with AI. Whereas most prior studies have focused on the favorable outcomes of AI for college students, the present research investigates its “double-edged sword” effects. Guided by social affiliation theory, a new model has been developed and empirically tested to clarify how and under what conditions the frequency of student–AI interaction influences social needs and behaviors. Longitudinal data obtained from 388 undergraduates showed that AI interaction frequency can shape prosocial behavior and problematic mobile phone use through a dual pathway involving the need for affiliation and feelings of loneliness. Furthermore, peer support moderates the indirect effect of AI interaction frequency on college students’ prosocial behavior via their need for affiliation. The results showed that peer support did not significantly moderate the indirect relationship between AI interaction frequency and problematic mobile phone use through loneliness. Overall, our study extends the framework of the social affiliation theory and provides practical insights that guide the appropriate use of AI by college students, thereby supporting the development of healthy social skills and technology engagement in the age of AI. © 2025 by the authors.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.54,,,"codex failed: 2026-02-18T17:33:03.011531Z ERROR codex_core::rollout::list: state db missing rollout path for thread 019c71cf-5a64-7bc3-9c71-b36c09815e3c

The results indicate that teachers' behavioral intention to use AI is positively associated with their self-efficacy, perceived social influence, and digital competence, with both self-efficacy and social influence serving as significant mediators. Furthermore, self-efficacy is positively related to social influence, while gender does not exert a significant moderating effect on any of the proposed paths. This study contributes to the integrated application of SCT and UTAUT in the context of physical education in higher education and offers theoretical and practical implications for enhancing digital competence and promoting intelligent transformation among college physical education teachers.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.85,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00814,What drives Chinese university students' long-term use of GenAI? Evidence from the heuristic-systematic model,"The growing adoption of generative AI (GenAI) in education underscores the importance of identifying the factors that shape university students' intentions to sustain their use of this technology. Despite its growing adoption, limited research has investigated how the attributes of GenAI shape students' sustained usage intentions. Grounded in the Heuristic-Systematic Model and Means-End-Chain Theory, this study conducted an online survey of university students in mainland China through random sampling (time1, n = 823; time2, n = 712), explores how heuristic factors (anthropomorphism and likability) and systematic factors (perceived intelligence and AI compatibility) influence students' intention to continue using GenAI, with utilitarian and hedonic values serving as mediators. The findings indicate that anthropomorphism, likability, perceived intelligence, and AI compatibility have a positive impact on students' intention to continue using GenAI. Moreover, utilitarian and hedonic values serve as mediators, linking these attributes to behavioral intentions, highlighting the dual role of value perceptions in driving continued use. The study highlights the fear of AI as a negative moderating factor that weakens the direct effects of these attributes on intention, emphasizing the critical role of individual characteristics in shaping human-AI interactions. This study enhances the literature on human-AI interaction by combining heuristic and systematic cues with user value perceptions to clarify the mechanisms driving the adoption and continued use of GenAI. The findings offer theoretical and practical insights, emphasizing the need for thoughtful design of GenAI attributes to enhance its utility and user experience while addressing concerns related to fear of AI to promote long-term engagement.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

It aims to identify the psychological and behavioral implications of AI usage in higher education, particularly in relation to students' selfconfidence, autonomy, gender, and perception of competence. Using a quantitative research design, the study surveyed 226 Spanish university students through an ad hoc online questionnaire. The instrument measured AI usage patterns, perceived usefulness and limitations of AI tools, and students' self-efficacy. Structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the relationships between perceived AI benefits, gender, and academic self-confidence. The results show a significant and positive relationship between students' perception of AI usefulness and their self-efficacy. No statistically significant gender differences were found in either AI adoption or the manifestation of Dunning-Kruger effects. The overall use of AI tools was positively associated with students perceived academic competence. This paper contributes to the growing body of literature on AI in education by focusing on its psychological effects, beyond technical performance.

It also examined the moderating role of perceived fairness in grading on the relationships of personality traits with GenAI usage. Further, the study examined the relationship of GenAI use with academic self-efficacy, learned helplessness, and academic performance. Finally, it explored the mediating role of GenAI use in the relationships of openness to experience, conscientiousness, and neuroticism with students' outcomes. Data were collected using a three-wave time-lagged online survey from a sample of 326 students enrolled in three Pakistani universities. Established scales from prior studies were used to measure all study variables and academic performance was measured through students' CGPA. Findings indicate that conscientiousness is negatively related to GenAI use. Findings also indicate that academic use of GenAI negatively relates to students' academic self-efficacy, and academic performance, and positively relates to learned helplessness. In addition, the study identifies some role of perceived fairness in grading although the effect was modest. Furthermore, use of GenAI mediated the effects of conscientiousness on academic outcomes. Finally, the theoretical and practical implications suggest that universities may take prompt action to regulate GenAI use, alongside concerted efforts to balance the potential benefits and repercussions of its use among students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

This study employed mixed data collection methods to investigate Vietnamese English majors’ use and acceptance of AI technologies for EFL writing. Quantitative data from 53 questionnaire responses revealed the prominent popularity of Generative AI in a range of AI tools in use, mainly for homework and self-study activities. However, compared with overcoming writer’s block or arranging ideas, AI assistance was more frequently sought to refine their academic use of English. Furthermore, adapting the revised UTAUT questionnaire by Hoi (2020), the results from 28 5-point-Likert-scale items revealed both male and female EFL learners’ high perceptions of the determinants of user acceptance of AI-assisted academic writing practice, except for social influence. Qualitative data from five semi-structured interviews reiterated the advantages of AI tools to the learners’ linguistic development, ideation efficiency, and learning attitudes. Besides underscoring the impact of instructors on their students’ tendency to adopt AI technologies for such productive skills, students also raised concerns over risks of misinformation, tech-overreliance, and resulting risks to creative and critical thinking.

Additionally, the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) was integrated with a diversity of educational constructs, including content availability (CA), learning engagement (LE), learning motivation (LM), learner involvement (LI), and AI satisfaction (AS). Furthermore, responses of 274 PY students from Saudi Universities were analysed using partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) to evaluate both the measurement and structural models. Likewise, the findings indicated CA (beta = 0.25), LE (beta = 0.22), LM (beta = 0.20), and LI (beta = 0.18) significantly predicted user intention (UI), explaining 52.2% of its variance (R2 = 0.522). In turn, UI significantly predicted students' digital sustainability conceptions (DSC) (beta = 0.35, R2 = 0.451). However, AI satisfaction (AS) did not exhibit a moderating effect, suggesting uniformly high satisfaction levels among students. Hence, the study concluded that AI-powered NLP models are being adopted as learning assistant technologies and are also essential catalysts in promoting sustainable digital conceptions. Similarly, this study contributes both theoretically and practically by conceptualising digital sustainability as a learner-driven construct and linking educational technology adoption to its advancement. This aligns with global frameworks such as Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 4 and 9. The study highlights AI's transformative potential in higher education by examining how user intention (UI) influences digital sustainability conceptions (DSC) among preparatory year students in Saudi Arabia.

REC_12355,UNRAVELING KNOWLEDGE-BASED CHATBOT ADOPTION INTENTION IN ENHANCING SPECIES LITERACY,"Aim/Purpose This research investigated the determinant factors influencing the adoption intentions of Chatsicum, a Knowledge-Based Chatbot (KBC) aimed at enhancing the species literacy of biodiversity students. Background This research was conducted to bridge the gap between technology, education, and biodiversity conservation. Innovative solutions are needed to empower individuals with knowledge, particularly species knowledge, in preserving the natural world. Methodology The study employed a quantitative approach using the Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and sampled 145 university students as respondents. The research model combined the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) framework with elements from the Diffusion of Innovation (DOI), including relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, and observability. Also, the model introduced perceived trust as an independent variable. The primary dependent variable under examination was the intention to use the KBC. Contribution The findings of this research contribute to a deeper understanding of the critical factors affecting the adoption of the KBC in biodiversity education and outreach, as studies in this context are limited. This study provides valuable insights for developers, educators, and policymakers interested in promoting species literacy and leveraging innovative technologies by analyzing the interplay of TTF and DOI constructs alongside perceived trust. Ultimately, this research aims to foster more effective and accessible biodiversity education strategies. Findings TTF influenced all DOI variables, such as relative advantage, compatibility, observability, and trust positively and complexity negatively. In conclusion, TTF strongly affected usage intention indirectly. However, relative advantage, complexity, and observability insignificantly influenced the intention to use. Meanwhile, compatibility and trust strongly affected the use intention. Recommendations Developers should prioritize building and maintaining chatbots that are for Practitioners aligned with the tasks, needs, and goals of the target users, as well as establishing trust through the assurance of information accuracy. Educators could develop tailored educational interventions that resonate with the values and preferences of diverse learners and are aligned closely with students’ learning needs, preferences, and curriculum while ensuring seamless integration with the existing educational context. Conservation organizations and policymakers could also utilize the findings of this study to enhance their outreach strategies, as the KBC is intended for students and biodiversity laypeople. Recommendations Researchers should explore the nuances of relationships between TTF and for Researchers DOI, as well as trust, and consider the potential influence of mediating and moderating variables to advance the field of technology adoption in educational contexts. Researchers could also explore why relative advantage, complexity, and observability did not significantly impact the usage intention and whether specific user segments or contextual factors influence these relationships. Impact on Society This research has significant societal impacts by improving species literacy, advancing technology in education, and promoting conservation efforts. Species knowledge could raise awareness regarding biodiversity and the importance of conservation, thereby leading to more informed and responsible citizens. Future Research Future works should address the challenges and opportunities presented by KBCs in the context of species literacy enhancement, for example, interventions or experiments to influence the non-significant factors. Furthermore, longitudinal studies should investigate whether user behavior evolves. Ultimately, examining the correlation between species literacy, specifically when augmented by chatbots, and tangible conservation practices is an imperative domain in the future. It may entail evaluating the extent to which enhanced knowledge leads to concrete measures promoting biodiversity preservation. © 2024 Informing Science Institute.

REC_00951,The Impact of AI Guilt on Students' Use of ChatGPT for Academic Tasks: Examining Disciplinary Differences,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools like ChatGPT are reshaping higher education, raising concerns about academic integrity alongside potential benefits. The psychological tension accompanying the decision whether to use GenAI or not for a particular task may lead to AI guilt-students' moral discomfort when using GenAI for traditionally human tasks. This study examines the impact of AI guilt on students' use of ChatGPT for academic tasks, focusing on disciplinary differences between pure and applied fields. We conducted a survey at a Singaporean university, measuring AI guilt and ChatGPT usage. Using logistic regression analysis, we found that AI guilt significantly reduces ChatGPT use for creativity-based tasks but not for routine-based tasks. The relationship between AI guilt and ChatGPT use is linear in pure fields, while applied fields show a nonlinear pattern. Specifically, the perceived risk of being detected and potential academic penalties decreases ChatGPT use in creativity-based tasks for all samples, while rationalization tendencies increase it. Interestingly, the interaction between rationalization tendencies and perceived social norms reduces usage, reflecting the tension between internal justification and external pressures. Heterogeneous analysis shows that rationalization tendencies and perceived risk influence pure fields more, whereas social norms drive applied fields more. These results show how AI guilt varies across disciplines and affects task-level GenAI tool use, offering insights for developing tailored ethical guidelines and integration strategies in higher education.",2025,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02358,ChatGPT in higher education - A Student's perspective,"The purpose of this study is to assess the impact of factors influencing students' adoption of ChatGPT within the context of higher education. With the rapid expansion of its user base and its increasing utilization across various fields, there is a pressing need to comprehensively explore students' interactions and experiences with this innovative technology, a topic largely unaddressed in existing literature. This paper aims to identify the factors contributing to ChatGPT's rapid proliferation and to highlight its potential for reshaping higher education. To achieve our research objective, we extend the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) with a quantitative approach. We collected data from a sample of 283 university students in the United Arab Emirates, employing a convenience sampling method. Our findings reveal significant impacts of students' trust, effort expectancy, performance expectancy, and hedonic motivation on their attitudes towards ChatGPT. Additionally, perceived risks and attitude towards ChatGPT significantly influence students' intentions to sustain its usage for educational purposes. Intriguingly, social influences were found to have no significant impact on students' intentions to engage with this AI-based chatbot. These findings have practical implications for the integration of ChatGPT in higher education. Educators and institutions should focus on building trust and enhancing students' perception of effort, performance, and hedonic aspects related to ChatGPT. Addressing perceived risks and fostering a positive attitude can promote sustained usage for educational purposes. This study contributes to the existing literature by shedding light on students' reception of ChatGPT in higher education, an underexplored area.

REC_03508,EFL students' motivation predicted by their self-efficacy and resilience in artificial intelligence (AI)-based context: From a self-determination theory perspective,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology becomes more integrated across various areas, institutes of higher education implement different AI tools to modernize their teaching methods. Incorporating AI into teaching has revolutionized conventional learning settings, providing innovative resources to boost student motivation and success. Motivation is a critical factor influencing English as a foreign language (EFL) learners' success in AI-based settings. However, understanding how psychological elements like self-efficacy and resilience impact motivation in these contexts remains a growing area of educational interest. Directed by Self-determination theory (SDT), which underlines the importance of autonomy, relatedness, and competence, the present research aims to reveal the intricate dynamics between EFL learners' self-efficacy, resilience, and learning motivation. To this aim, data were collected from 472 EFL students in four Chinese universities including a range of academic majors including computer science, ecology, history, and business with most participants being freshmen and sophomores. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to evaluate the measurement model and multiple regression analyses investigated the predictive effects of self-efficacy and resilience on EFL learners' motivation. Indeed, the results indicated that resilience and self-efficacy were both significant predictors of motivation, jointly explaining 54.2 % of its variance. Nonetheless, resilience was a strong predictor, uniquely explaining 24.71 % of its variance against self-efficacy's 14.75 %. The findings highlight SDT's relevance in explaining how psychological factors influence motivation in AIbased settings. Moreover, the results underscore the relativeness of SDT's fundamental concepts in describing how psychological elements affect learning motivation in AI-based settings. The present research offers precious knowledge for teachers, policymakers, and scholars aiming to optimize AI tools in teaching. Practical recommendations include targeted strategies to enhance learners' self-efficacy and resilience, thereby fostering motivation.

REC_12364,USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS TO CLUSTER AND ANALYSE STUDENTS’ ACCEPTANCE OF MOBILE LEARNING MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS,"Aim/Purpose Technology adoption and utilization in educational institutions have increased since the pandemic. Recently, the learning management system has become crucial in the educational sector, enabling the efficient execution of online learning. In this study, we performed clustering on group learners to understand students’ concerns with the mobile Learning Management System (m-LMS) based on the clusters. Furthermore, we employed classification using the technology acceptance model to evaluate the correlation among factors necessitating the acceptance and use of m-LMS. Background Mobile learning (m-learning) is a prevalent method of education where educational content is accessed on the go via mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets. The acceptance and deployment of mobile learning in higher education institutions has become essential in Education 4.0, a reskilling approach associated with Industry 4.0. Since the pandemic, mobile learning management systems have seen increased usage among educational institutions. Methodology The study modified the standard data mining and knowledge discovery methodology. This study’s data set includes 446 students from the University of Education, Winneba, Ghana. The K-means algorithm was implemented to determine the number of clusters from the dataset according to the features. Subsequently, we employed a Pearson correlation coefficient heatmap to ascertain the predictability of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude towards using, and actual system use of the features via the technology acceptance model. Then, a classifier was built by comparing five classification algorithms. Contribution A novel study on the application of a machine learning algorithm for a mobile learning management system dataset in Ghana. Implementing K-means, heatmap, and feature selection to understand learners’ concerns while using m-LMS in Ghana. Findings The findings indicate that Cluster 1 members disagree with the benefits of using m-LMS. The disagreement cuts across all the investigated variables: perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, attitude toward using, and actual use. Cluster 2 members agree strongly with the benefits of using m-LMS across all the investigated variables. Cluster 0, with the highest number of members, moderately agrees with the benefits of using m-LMS. In addition, a strong correlation exists between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude towards using. Furthermore, the attitude towards using was predicted by perceived usefulness. However, there was an unreliable relationship between attitude towards using and actual system use. Recommendations Cluster segmentation of students using m-LMS facilitates the formulation of an for Practitioners implementation policy, enabling educational authorities to address the issues contributing to student dissatisfaction with m-LMS. Furthermore, the results imply that, even though students desire to use a mobile learning management system, they are not using it. It means there are challenges surrounding using the mobile learning management system at the University of Education, Winneba. Recommendations The use of K-means, elbow function, and correlation heatmap in the technolfor Researchers ogy acceptance model for variable correlation test reveals detailed predictability patterns that necessitate a new research direction using machine learning. Impact on Society Stakeholders in education should embrace and support machine learning implementation in the educational sector to reveal data patterns for improved teaching and learning. Future Research Subsequent research will broaden the data on mobile learning management systems to include the majority of tertiary institutions in Ghana. The data will be indicative, allowing for the generalisation of inferences regarding national policy directions on m-LMS. © (2025), (Informing Science Institute).

REC_11168,"The Impact of Socio-Cultural and Demographic Factors on Gen AI Accessibility, Usability, and Applicability in the UAE","Despite rapid AI integration in education globally, the role of socio-cultural and demographic factors in shaping AI adoption in diverse settings like the UAE remains underexplored. This study explores the accessibility, usability, and applicability of generative AI (Gen AI) tools, such as ChatGPT, in higher education, focusing on Emirati university students. Employing a mixed-methods research design, data were collected from 83 students through demographic surveys and structured reflections based on Gibbs' Reflective Cycle (Gibbs, 1988). Quantitative analysis showed strong links between how Gen AI uses AI and demographic and educational factors, such as high school type, gender, and academic performance, with a slight trend seen for the father's education level. Students from private international schools reported higher daily usage, while females showed greater weekly usage frequencies, emphasizing the influence of educational background and gender on technology adoption. Thematic analysis identified Gen AI accessibility as a key theme, with students highlighting the instant feedback and time-saving benefits of Gen AI tools. However, disparities in digital literacy and infrastructural challenges remain. The Gen AI Usability Study showed that students liked the detailed feedback and how it broke down complex ideas.

REC_12366,A MODEL FOR THE ADOPTION OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE IN INCLUSIVE EDUCATION: AN EXPLORATORY STUDY OF KEY FACTORS AND EXPERT INSIGHTS,"Aim/Purpose This study adopts a mixed-method approach to examine the factors influencing the adoption of AI-based assistive technologies among students with special needs. Specifically, it explores the roles of social support, motivation, digital literacy, and self-efficacy in shaping students' perceptions and behavioral intentions toward these technologies within inclusive education settings. Background The integration of assistive technologies into inclusive learning environments has gained significant attention due to its potential to improve educational outcomes for students with disabilities. Despite this growing interest, limited empirical research has explored the determinants of such technologies' adoption, particularly through the technology acceptance model lens. This study addresses this gap by extending the technology acceptance model framework to incorporate additional constructs such as social support, motivation, digital literacy, and self-efficacy, offering a more comprehensive understanding of user acceptance in inclusive contexts. Methodology A mixed-method design was employed. The quantitative phase involved a survey of 118 students enrolled in six inclusive education programs across Saudi Arabian universities. Data were analyzed using structural equation modeling via SmartPLS to examine the relationships between the proposed constructs. Complementing this, the qualitative phase included in-depth interviews with eight AI experts specializing in assistive technologies for students with disabilities, providing contextual insights and validating the quantitative findings. Contribution This study advances the technology acceptance model by integrating key psychological and social variables (social support, motivation, digital literacy, and self-efficacy) into the adoption framework. Doing so offers a more nuanced perspective on how students with special needs interact with and perceive AI-based assistive tools, addressing a critical gap in current inclusive education research. Findings The findings from the quantitative analysis indicate that social support and motivation significantly enhance perceived usefulness, while digital literacy and self-efficacy significantly enhance perceived ease of use. Both usefulness and ease of use substantially affect intention toward adopting assistive technology. Additionally, the qualitative findings reveal key themes emphasizing userfriendly designs, contextual adaptability, ethical considerations, and AI's potential to promote student autonomy. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Expert interviews underscore the necessity for ongoing professional development among educators to effectively implement assistive AI tools. Furthermore, fostering partnerships between technology developers and educators is critical for designing tools that meet the real-world needs of inclusive classrooms. By extending the technology acceptance model, this study opens new avenues for future research into other influencing factors, such as institutional readiness, cultural considerations, and policy support. Researchers are encouraged to apply this enriched model in various educational and geographical contexts to further validate its applicability. Impact on Society Understanding the factors that influence the adoption of assistive technology is essential for fostering inclusive and equitable education systems. This study contributes to the development of policies and implementation strategies that ensure students with disabilities can fully benefit from emerging educational technologies.

REC_12368,EMPOWERING FACULTY IN CREATIVE AND CULTURAL DISCIPLINES: AI LITERACY AND IMAGE GENERATOR INTEGRATION IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Aim/Purpose This study empirically analyzes how a tailored AI literacy initiative can empower higher education faculty in creative and cultural-focused disciplines to adopt AI image generators into their courses. It achieves that by first identifying the foundational components required for developing an AI literacy initiative for integrating AI image generators into creative and cultural courses (RQ1) and then assessing how an AI literacy workshop designed around these components influences faculty's perceived confidence, understanding, and readiness to adopt AI image generators (RQ2). Background The proliferation of AI image generators has disrupted the Creative and Cultural Industries (CCI), creating both opportunities and challenges for educators. Faculty face barriers such as limited technical skills, ethical concerns, and a lack of pedagogical strategies. Despite growing interest, few AI literacy initiatives are tailored to the unique needs of creative and culturally-focused faculty. Our study is presented against such a backdrop. Methodology A two-phase mixed-methods approach was conducted. Phase One involved focus group interviews (Activity 1) with faculty in CCI-focused disciplines (e.g., arts, design, architecture, marketing, music, fashion, film, IT, and the like) to identify key components for designing an AI literacy initiative. In Phase Two, the designed workshop (Activity 2) was delivered to 51 CCI faculty from a mid-western university. Data was collected through pre-and post-workshop surveys, as well as live polls to assess changes in participants' perception around AI image generators' adoption into their courses. Contribution This study offers multiple contributions. The systematic data collection and analysis of participants' data (empirical contribution) through a mixed-methods approach, which combines statistical analysis and human-AI thematic analysis (methodological contribution), informed the design and development of an AI literacy workshop (artifactual contribution) tailored for higher education faculty in CCI disciplines. Additionally, it contributes to the underexplored area of adopting image generators ethically and via pedagogical best practices into creative and cultural education. Findings In Activity 1, the key components for designing an AI literacy initiative tailored for CCI faculty include technical skills, ethical awareness, and pedagogical strategies combined with practical applications and continuous AI Literacy support/resources. In Activity 2, faculty showed a positive attitudinal shift. They reported increased confidence, pedagogical and ethical awareness, access to institutional resources, and practical applications post-workshop. They expressed appreciation for image generators as complementary tools and readiness to integrate them into their teaching. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Institutions should support faculty development through accessible AI tools, discipline-based literacy resources, hands-on training, and ongoing learning opportunities tailored to them. Interdisciplinary collaboration and developing ethical guidelines are essential for responsible GenAI adoption. Future research should examine the long-term impacts of AI literacy initiatives on teaching and learning outcomes, exploring other multimodal GenAIs, and include broader stakeholders (e.g., students, administrators, and even technologists). Impact on Society Equipping higher education faculty with AI literacy around GenAIs fosters responsible technology adoption and use, enhances teaching practices and learning outcomes, and prepares students to thrive in an AI-driven workforce, where humans and AIs can co-exist, collaborate, and co-create. Future Research Future research should include longitudinal studies to assess faculty engagement and student outcomes. Expanding future research across institutions and academic levels (e.g., K-12) will help develop scalable, discipline-specific AI literacy resources, initiatives, and frameworks.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.58,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02366,The influence of social norms and word-of-mouth marketing on behavioral intention and behavioral use of generative AI chatbots among university students,"The increasing prevalence of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven chatbots, particularly generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and similar large language models, in higher education necessitates a deeper understanding of the factors influencing their adoption and use by university students. This study examines the impact of word-ofmouth (WOM) marketing and social norms on the behavioral intention and effective use of generative AI chatbots among university students in Peru. Using a partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach, data from 562 university students were analyzed. The results revealed that both WOM (beta = 0.569***) and social norms (beta = 0.253**) significantly influence the intention to use chatbots, with WOM having a stronger effect. Furthermore, behavioral intention was found to be a significant predictor of actual chatbot use (beta = 0.711***). The study contributes to existing technology adoption models by incorporating social dimensions specific to the university context. These findings have important implications for chatbot designers, educators, and university administrators in the development of effective strategies for implementing and promoting these technologies in educational settings. The study underscores the need to consider social dynamics and peer networks in chatbot implementation strategies within university environments, potentially improving students' educational experiences and academic outcomes.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.76,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01832,Modelling economics students’ use of ChatGPT and academic performance: insights from self-determination theory and epistemic curiosity,"ChatGPT, a generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tool, has gained recognition as a valuable educational technology (EdTech) resource, yet its impact on students' academic outcomes in Ghana remains unclear. This study examined the impact of use of ChatGPT on academic achievement among higher education (HE) students using the “interactive-constructive-active–passive (ICAP)” framework and “self-determination theory (SDT)”. A purposive sample of 457 HE economics students from a public university in Ghana was selected. The study used adapted scales of ICAP (i.e. measuring the use of ChatGPT), “desire to learn (DFL), self-efficacy (SE), beliefs about the future (BAF), epistemic curiosity (EP) and perceived academic performance (AP)”. Data were analysed using “partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA)”. PLS-SEM results indicated that the use of ChatGPT (ICAP) positively influenced DFL, SE, BAF and AP. DFL and BAF were positively associated with AP, whereas SE showed a negative association with AP. Furthermore, DFL, SE and BAF mediated the relationship between the use of ChatGPT and AP. EP directly influenced DFL, SE and BAF and moderated the positive influence of ChatGPT usage on DFL and BAF. FsQCA results revealed four configurations for achieving high AP. This study highlights the positive role of ChatGPT in the academic performance of economics students and underlines the importance of considering multiple factors in policy and intervention strategies to optimise the use of AI in higher education. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.86,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02369,"Influence of perceived ethics, prejudice, and teacher concerns on artificial intelligence literacy and implementation: A cross-sectional study using path analysis","This study examines the influence of perceived ethics, bias, and teacher concerns on artificial intelligence (AI) literacy and implementation in Peruvian universities. Using a quantitative correlational approach, data were collected from 422 university professors across eight institutions in northern Peru. The research employed structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to test a hypothetical model comprising five constructs: perceived ethics, bias in AI, teacher concerns, AI literacy, and AI implementation. The results revealed two significant relationships: AI literacy strongly influences AI implementation, and bias in AI significantly affects AI literacy. In contrast to expectations, perceived ethics and teacher concerns had no significant influence on AI literacy. Additionally, demographic variables (age and gender) had no moderating effects on the relationships between the constructs. The findings suggest that enhancing AI literacy and addressing algorithmic bias are crucial factors for successful AI integration in higher education, whereas ethical considerations and teacher concerns may play a less significant role than previously theorized.

REC_01111,Students’ acceptance and use of generative AI in pharmacy education: international cross-sectional survey based on the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,"Background: Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has significant potential implications for pharmacy education, but its ethical, practical, and pedagogical implications have not been fully explored. Aim: This international study evaluated pharmacy students’ acceptance and use of GenAI tools using the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Method: A cross-sectional survey of pharmacy students from nine countries during the first half of 2024 assessed GenAI usage patterns, curricular integration, and acceptance via the Extended UTAUT framework. After appropriate translation and cultural adaptation, exploratory factor analysis (EFA) identified key adoption factors. Results: A total of 2009 responses were received. ChatGPT and Quillbot were the tools most frequently utilised. EFA identified three key dimensions: Utility-Driven Adoption, Affordability and Habitual Integration, and Social Influence. Students rated performance and effort expectancy highly, highlighting their perceived usefulness and ease of use of GenAI tools. In contrast, habit and price value received lower ratings, indicating barriers to habitual use and affordability concerns. Gender disparities were noted, with males demonstrating significantly higher acceptance (p < 0.001). Additionally, country-specific differences were evident, as Malaysia reported a high performance expectancy, while Egypt exhibited low facilitating conditions. Over 20% indicated an over-reliance on GenAI for assignments, raising ethical concerns. Significant gaps were observed, such as limited ethical awareness—only 10% prioritised legal and ethical training—and uneven curricular integration, with 60% reporting no formal exposure to Generative AI.

REC_12391,Using ChatGPT as a virtual speaking tutor to boost EFL learners’ speaking self-efficacy,"Expressing thoughts and feelings efficiently is fundamental in daily, academic, and professional life. Accordingly, self-efficacy beliefs play pivotal roles in shaping learners’ speaking performance through various dimensions. Higher education institutions assume responsibility for boosting students’ speaking self-efficacy, thereby contributing to their self-confidence in different venues. Meanwhile, AI-integrated English classes are on the rise thanks to their overt advantages. In this regard, this study investigated the role of ChatGPT in improving speaking self-efficacy of EFL learners who were selected randomly among sophomore students in Advanced English classes at the tertiary level in Erbil, Iraq. Forty-four students whose ages ranged from 18 to 27 joined the study to represent the control or experimental group voluntarily within 8 weeks in the 2024–2025 academic year. Control group students took part in speaking sessions in classes, whereas experimental group students took advantage of ChatGPT as a speaking tutor to support their learning in classes with given topics in line with the coursebook. Data collection was implemented through speaking exams, questionnaires, and interviews, the analyses of which were conducted using SPSS 29 and MAXQDA. Findings unearthed that ChatGPT is a promising tool to increase students’ speaking self-efficacy scores because it offers a welcoming atmosphere to receive constructive feedback, play recordings several times, and balanced instruction according to learners’ levels. Thus, they could relieve speaking anxiety and speak more self-assuredly. The current study’s findings may have varied reflections for interested parties engaged in integrating AI tools into speaking classes harmoniously. © 2025 Bunyamin Celik, Yunus Yildiz & Saban Kara.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03559,Factors affecting Artificial Intelligence usage intention among nursing students: Unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,"Background: Nursing students' acceptance and usage of AI are crucial for embracing and implementing the technology in nursing practice in the future. However, there is a lack of literature to examine the factors affecting AI usage intention among nursing students. Aim: This study examined a hypothesized model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2). The intention to use AI mediates the impact of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit on nursing students' AI usage. Gender was expected to moderate these relationships. Methods: Employing a multicenter cross-sectional approach, this study was conducted across three Saudi universities between September and October 2023 with 500 undergraduate nursing students. The variables were measured using a self-report questionnaire originally developed based on UTAUT2. The internal consistency of the latent variable items and convergent, divergent, and construct validity were assessed. Structural equation modeling was conducted to test the hypothesized model. Results: Performance expectancy (beta = 0.235, p = .004), facilitating conditions (beta = 0.233, p = .026), hedonic motivation (beta = 0.371, p < .001), and habit (beta = 0.458, p < .001) influenced AI usage intention, which significantly affected actual AI usage (beta = 0.702, p < .001). Behavioral intention mediated the relationship between AI usage in nursing education and performance expectancy (beta = 0.165, p = .007), motivation (beta = 0.261, p = .001), and habit (beta = 0.321, p = .002). Gender moderated the effects of behavioral intention (Delta beta = 0.613, p = .005) and facilitated conditions (Delta beta = -0.440, p = .023) on AI usage. Conclusions: The findings will help stakeholders promote AI usage among future nurses. They highlight the need for interventions and strategies to enhance the perceptions of AI's benefits, resource availability, and individuals' enthusiasm and usage habits.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07602,College Teachers' Behavioral Intention to Adopt Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Teaching Systems,"Given the extensive application of artificial intelligence (AI) within the educational domain, college teachers' behavioral intention to adopt AI-assisted teaching systems (AIATS) has emerged as a critical topic, with gaps in the breadth of samples and the diversity of methods. To further delve into the principal elements affecting college teachers' inclination towards AIATS, this research constructs an integrative theoretical framework that synthesizes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), while comprehensively considering internal and external factors. The investigation collected sample data from a questionnaire survey, which reached 529 college teachers in China, and undertook data analysis employing SPSS 27.0 and AMOS 26.0. The findings revealed that: 1) college teachers' behavioral intention to embrace AIATS is directly and significantly shaped by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust and subjective norms; 2) factors such as observability, relative advantage and compatibility indirectly impact college teachers' adoption willingness of AIATS through their perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness; 3) complexity of AIATS positively affects perceived ease of use by means of perceived time cost, thereby influencing behavioral intention; 4) sociocultural factors significantly impact the adoption and promotion of AIATS in China. By extending the applicability of TAM and IDT within the realm of educational technology acceptance, this study offers strategic recommendations geared towards educational policymakers and technology developers to promote the implementation of AIATS, and sheds light on educational technology adoption across diverse sociocultural landscapes.",2024,WoS; Scopus; IEEE,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11219,Unlocking the Future of Education: Empirical Insights into the Adoption of Generative AI in Higher Education,"This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption and use of generative AI technologies (GenAI) in higher education through a comprehensive survey of 592 university professors across the USA and Canada, using both quantitative and qualitative data. The results reveal that educators primarily benefit from using GenAI to create course materials more efficiently and enhance students' learning outcomes. However, significant concerns persist regarding the accuracy of AI-generated content and the privacy and security of data. The qualitative analysis further identified six common themes: efficiency and time-saving, creativity and innovation, engagement with technology, support in research and learning, skepticism or uncertainty, and contextual dependency. Our findings also indicate that perceived enjoyment and performance expectancy are the most crucial drivers for adopting GenAI, whereas perceived risk substantially deters educators from integrating these technologies. Additionally, age negatively affects use and amplifies the effect of perceived risk on intention; female educators report higher intention than males, with social influence exerting a stronger positive and perceived risk a stronger negative association with intention among female educators. This research substantially contributes to the Information Systems (IS) literature by empirically examining GenAI use in higher education with a large sample size. The study not only highlights the practical benefits and risks associated with GenAI but also provides a nuanced understanding of the psychological factors influencing educators' decisions. These findings offer actionable insights for developers to address educators' concerns and for educational institutions to develop strategies that facilitate the effective and responsible integration of GenAI technologies in academic settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09430,Factors Influencing the Acceptance of ChatGPT in High Education: An Integrated Model With PLS-SEM and fsQCA Approach,"The swift incorporation of artificial intelligence (AI) into higher education has significantly propelled the digital transformation of education. This advancement is crucial for educators aiming to augment teaching quality through AI technologies, such as ChatGPT. However, the acceptance of ChatGPT among college students remains underexplored. This paper aims to clarify the determinants influencing college students' acceptance of ChatGPT and to facilitate its widespread adoption in higher education. To achieve this, we integrate the Technology Readiness Index (TRI), Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to develop a novel research framework. Employing a mixed-method approach that includes PLS-SEM and fsQCA, we analyze data from 298 Chinese college students. Our findings indicate that discomfort and insecurity adversely affect Perceived Ease of Use (PEU) and Perceived Usefulness (PU) in the context of ChatGPT adoption. Additionally, both PEU and PU positively impact attitudes, which, in conjunction with Subjective Norms (SN) and Perceived Behavioral Control (PBC), bolster the intention to accept ChatGPT. Insights from fsQCA reveal that the acceptance of ChatGPT among students is not driven by a singular factor but by an amalgamation of these elements, underscoring the complex nature of technology adoption. The paper concludes with practical recommendations for educators and designers to refine curriculum design and teaching methodologies, boost student engagement and learning efficacy, and promote the broader adoption of educational technology.

REC_01200,"Chat or cheat? Academic dishonesty, risk perceptions, and ChatGPT usage in higher education students","Academic dishonesty remains a persistent concern for educational institutions, threatening the reputation of universities. The emergence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools exacerbates this challenge as they can be used for chatting but also for cheating. Several scientific papers have analyzed the advantages and risks of using AI tools like ChatGPT in academia. On the one side it offers increased accessibility of information and facilitates personalized learning. On the other side several risks are associated with the usage of ChatGPT, including the generation of inaccurate information, and the facilitation of academic dishonesty like cheating and plagiarism. This study examines how students' Perception of Academic Dishonesty (PAD) and their perception of the risks associated with using ChatGPT, are linked to a reduced use frequency and intention to use this AI tool. A sample of 468 undergraduate students answered an online survey. Our findings indicate a negative and significant relationship between perceived risk, and both use frequency and intention to use ChatGPT in the future. Additionally, perceived risk mediates the relationship between PAD and ChatGPT usage patterns. This is the first study to demonstrate that students with high PAD present higher levels of awareness of the risks associated with using ChatGPT, which is associated with lower frequency of use and intention to use this AI tool in higher education. These results highlight the importance of integrating such technologies into the university, while carefully considering ethical issues and students' perceptions of risk.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.87,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03560,"Artificial intelligence and academic integrity in nursing education: A mixed methods study on usage, perceptions, and institutional implications","Background: The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) use in higher education has generated substantial debate among academics and students, given the potential for students to engage in academic misconduct through the misuse of AI. Academics argue that AI poses a serious threat to the foundational development of nurses through the questionable integrity of AI-generated academic work and by undermining the development of critical thinking skills essential for professional practice. However, there is limited research on nursing students' integration of AI technologies in their studies. Method: This study utilised a convergent parallel mixed methods approach to develop a multiphase approach with convergent parallel techniques for the qualitative and quantitative phases. The quantitative method utilised a Qualtrics-powered online survey to engage 188 nursing students, exploring various domains related to AI use. In the qualitative phase, in-depth interviews with 13 purposively sampled students provided deeper insights. The qualitative data were analysed using an inductive thematic analysis approach, while the quantitative data were analysed using SPSS. Result: In the survey, 24 % of respondents reported using AI, ranging from moderate to extensive usage. In logistics regression analysis, hearing about AI (OR = 3.9; CI 1.07-10.2; p < 0.05), the belief that AI was useful in the studies (OR = 5.5; CI 1.7-17.3; p < 0.01), and the perception that learning to use AI is easy (OR = 3.4; CI 1.1-11.1; p < 0.05) predicted AI use. Qualitative findings revealed that all students used AI for various academic purposes. The 'fascinating', 'intelligent' and 'efficient' nature of AI in handling 'time-consuming' academic tasks motivated its use. However, concerns about breaching academic integrity and the value of achieving success through personal effort served as deterrents. Conclusion: The findings suggest that while AI's efficiency drives students to adopt it, they remain cautious about its ethical implications, leading to uncertainty in its application within academic practices. This highlights the critical need for institutional support and explicit guidelines on responsible AI integration in educational settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.74,,,"codex failed: 2026-02-18T17:35:52.255307Z ERROR codex_core::rollout::list: state db missing rollout path for thread 019c71cf-5a64-7bc3-9c71-b36c09815e3c

REC_12394,"Spontaneous Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Preparing for College English Test: GenAI Adoption Factors, Learners’ Motivation, and Self-Efficacy","This study investigates the adoption and impact of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools on English as a foreign language (EFL) learners, focusing on self-efficacy, motivation, and predicted exam performance. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research combines survey data (N = 595) and interviews (N = 8) from Chinese university students preparing for the College English Test 4. The quantitative analysis shows that positive attitudes, perceived usefulness, and ease of use predict GenAI usage frequency, while intrinsic motivation negatively correlates with use. GenAI use frequency did not significantly affect predicted test scores or self-efficacy levels. Younger students used GenAI more frequently. The qualitative data reveal that students primarily use GenAI as supplementary learning resources, which, while beneficial, do not substantially enhance self-efficacy or predicted exam performance. The study found a knowledge gap in the effectiveness of these tools in EFL contexts. It suggests strategies for optimizing GenAI in EFL learning, including blending with traditional methods, providing user training, balancing technology with traditional approaches, ensuring equal access, and customizing GenAI for education. The findings imply a need for educators to supervise GenAI use and for institutions to facilitate effective integration. Future research should examine the long-term and cultural effects of GenAI use in education. © 2025 Tianshi Hao, Xinyu Zhao & Zijin Lu.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.83,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03563,Identifying highly correlated determinants influencing student nurses' behavioral intention of using generative artificial intelligence (Generative AI): A network analysis,"Aim: This study aims to identify the most critical factors influencing nursing students' behavioral intention to use generative artificial intelligence by developing a network structure. Background: Generative artificial intelligence is increasingly integrated into nursing education and clinical nursing practice. Studies have explored the factors influencing behavioral intentions toward the use of Artificial Intelligence, but research specific to Generative Artificial Intelligence is still lacking. It's crucial for nursing students to use generative artificial intelligence effectively, especially as clinical environments change rapidly in the digital era. Thus, it is important to identify the key factors that influence their intention to use. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted. 800 participants were recruited from November to December 2023 through convenient sampling. Network analysis was applied in this study to identify the important nodes that are the most critical target goals for improving the behavioral intention of using Generative artificial intelligence by R package. Results: The network analysis indicated that Artificial Intelligence Relevance, Ethical Awareness About Artificial Intelligence served as central factors in the network of Generative Artificial Intelligence Intention of using (EI = 1.19, 1.06). Artificial Intelligence Literacy was a key bridge node linking the Generative Artificial Intelligence Intention of using with its influencing factor associations (BEI = 0.33). Conclusions: Generative Artificial Intelligence Relevance, Ethical Awareness about Generative Artificial Intelligence and Generative Artificial Intelligence Literacy serves as potential targets for enhancing nursing students' behavioral intention.

Background: Possible applications of artificial intelligence-powered systems in nursing cover all aspects of nursing care, from patient care to risk management. Although the final acceptance of artificial intelligence in practice will depend on positive 'nurses' attitudes toward artificial intelligence, those attitudes have gained little attention so far.Design: A cross-sectional multicenter study.Methods: The study was performed at nursing schools of four Croatian universities, surveying a total of 336 firstyear nursing students (response rate 69.7%) enrolled in 2021. A validated instrument, the General Attitudes towards Artificial Intelligence Scale, consisting of 20 Likert-type items, was chosen for the study. Where applicable, the items were contextualized for nursing. Four sub-scales were identified based on the outcomes of the factor analysis.Results: The average attitude score was (mean & PLUSMN; standard deviation) 64.5 & PLUSMN; 11.7, out of a maximum of 100, which was significantly higher than the neutral score of 60.0 (p < 0.001). The attitude towards AI did not differ across the universities and was not associated with students' age. Male students scored slightly higher than their female colleagues. Scores on subscales Benefits of artificial intelligence in nursing, Willingness to use artificial intelligence in nursing practice, and Dangers of artificial intelligence were favorable of artificial intelligencebased solutions. However, scores on the subscale Practical advantages of artificial intelligence were somewhat unfavorable.Conclusions: First-year nursing students had slightly positive attitudes towards artificial intelligence in nursing, which should make it easier for the new generations of nurses to embrace and implement artificial intelligence systems.

This study explores the factors influencing L2 majors' intention to use GenAI for learning, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Data were collected from 668 L2 majors at various Chinese universities through an online questionnaire with six validated scales. Structural equation modeling (SEM) via AMOS 24 revealed several key findings. First, demographic factors (gender and age) did not significantly affect the TPB constructs. Second, subjective norm and attitude positively influenced behavioral intention, while perceived behavioral control did not have a significant effect, contrary to TPB predictions. Additionally, GenAI literacy was found to be a positive predictor of behavioral intention, both directly and indirectly through attitude. External beliefs positively influenced subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitude, which in turn impacted behavioral intention, with mediation effects observed through subjective norm and attitude. However, perceived behavioral control did not mediate the relationship between external beliefs and behavioral intention.

REC_12423,Exploring AI integration in biology self-learning: A TAM-based analysis among high school students in Ho Chi Minh City,"As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to shape education, its role in self-directed learning, particularly in biology, remains underexplored. This study investigates AI adoption among high school students in Ho Chi Minh City using the technology acceptance model (TAM), integrating structural equation modeling, thematic analysis, and latent Dirichlet allocation topic modeling. Findings challenge traditional TAM assumptions, revealing that while perceived usefulness positively influences attitude toward use, it does not significantly predict behavioral intention. Additionally, perceived ease of use is not a strong predictor of AI adoption, highlighting the unique demands of biology education. A key finding is that adoption constraints, including concerns about AI accuracy, privacy, and limited experimental capabilities, significantly hinder AI adoption. Students predominantly use AI for exam preparation and homework support, rather than for exploratory learning or experimental simulations. AI-based quizzes are perceived as the most useful, whereas open-ended AI chatbots are less engaging for biology learning. The study underscores that biology students require AI tools that extend beyond theoretical learning to include laboratory simulations, data analysis, and experimental design support. To enhance AI adoption, this study recommends AI literacy programs for students and educators, the development of AI-driven virtual laboratory tools, and improved accuracy and reliability of AI- generated biological content.

REC_03584,The mediation effect of AI self-efficacy between AI literacy and learning engagement in college nursing students: A cross-sectional study,"Aim: This study investigates the mediating role of artificial intelligence self-efficacy (AISE) in the association between AI literacy and learning engagemeg nursing students in higher education. Background: The fourth technological revolution driven by AI has profound implications for healthcare education. Insufficient AI literacy and AISE among nursing students may hinder their learning engagement, yet empirical evidence on these relationships remains limited. Design: A cross-sectional study. Method: A convenience sampling method was used to select 2029 nursing students from 29 colleges in China from November to December 2024. A general information questionnaire, AI literacy scale, AISE scale and learning engagement scale were used to conduct the online questionnaire survey. Data were analyzed using descriptive analysis, Pearson correlation test and Bootstrap method. Results: Results show that AI literacy was positively correlated with AISE and learning engagement (r = 0.462-0.435, P<0.01) and AISE was positively correlated with learning engagement (r = 0.537, P<0.01). The indirect effect of AI literacy on learning engagement through AISE was 0.130, accounting for 20.44 % of the total effect. Conclusion: The AI literacy of nursing students is suboptimal; thus, enhancing foundational AI education is essential. AI literacy directly predicts learning engagement, with AISE serving as a partial mediator. Educators should integrate AI training into curricula, provide practical scenarios and foster interdisciplinary collaboration to improve AI competency and engagement.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09449,Generative AI Use Among Saudi and Korean Language Learners in Higher Education: Examination Through a Modified TAM Framework,"This study explores the integration of generative AI (GAI) tools in second language acquisition (SLA) through an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). Focusing on Saudi and Korean English language learners (ELLs), it examines the relationships among perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, perceived benefits, and actual use (i.e., task-based behavior) of GAI in English foreign language (EFL) learning. While perceived usefulness captures the functional utility of GAI tools for specific language learning tasks, perceived benefits encompass broader educational outcomes, including enhanced language proficiency, greater academic support, and increased learner confidence. Data were collected from 681 participants (407 Saudi, 274 Korean) and analyzed using mean scores, correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM). The model demonstrated a satisfactory fit, explaining 79% of the variance in actual use, with the model accounting for 70% of the variance in perceived benefits. Comparing models with and without perceived benefits revealed a 6% increase in explained variance (Delta R 2 = .06). Cross-cultural differences emerged in learner perceptions and adoption intentions, providing a deeper understanding of how students engage with GAI tools in language learning contexts.

REC_01857,Educators’ perceptions and willingness to integrate Generative Artificial Intelligence in teaching and research: evidence from Kenyan higher education,"The rapid emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) presents both opportunities and challenges for higher education, yet empirical evidence from sub-Sahara African contexts, particularly Kenya, remains limited. This study addresses this gap by examining how university educators’ perceptions of GenAI influence their willingness to integrate it into teaching and research. Framed by the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the study employed a quantitative survey design, collecting data from 137 educators across 13 Kenyan universities. The analysis focused on both perceived benefits and concerns, recognizing educators as critical gatekeepers in the adoption process. Findings indicate that while educators acknowledge GenAI’s potential to enhance instructional quality, research productivity, and learner engagement, they also express significant apprehensions regarding ethical risks, academic integrity, and the erosion of essential human elements in education. Perceived usefulness emerged as the strongest predictor of adoption willingness, underscoring the primacy of practical value in shaping acceptance. The study concludes that successful GenAI integration in Kenyan higher education will require alignment with ethical policies, targeted capacity-building, and transparent institutional support systems to mitigate risks and foster responsible use. These findings contribute to the limited literature on AI adoption in African higher education and highlight the need for context-specific strategies that address both infrastructural constraints and stakeholder perceptions. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.82,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01858,AI-driven career guidance: comparing Nigerian undergraduate and postgraduate perceptions,"The rapid evolution of global workforce demands, particularly in Nigeria, where unemployment remains high despite significant educational advancements, has brought to the fore the need for people to align their career aspirations with the opportunities and industrial needs within the country. While traditional career guidance services in the country have struggled to help individuals achieve tangible results in career choices and development, Artificial Intelligence-driven career guidance has emerged as a viable alternative. This research investigates how Nigerian students perceive AI-driven personalized career guidance services, identifying factors influencing their adoption and providing insights for technology developers and policymakers. Using a multi-stage sampling technique, data were collected through a close-ended questionnaire administered to Nigerian students. Three hundred and forty-one participants, either undergraduate or postgraduate students in Nigeria, completed the survey. A descriptive analysis and independent t-test were conducted to examine and compare the perceptions of undergraduate and postgraduate students regarding career guidance and the adoption of AI-driven personalized career guidance. The results show that postgraduate students(M = 4.53, SD = 0.65) exhibit significantly greater confidence in making informed career decisions than undergraduates (M = 4.29, SD = 0.83). Additionally, both undergraduate (M = 4.00, SD = 0.82) and postgraduate students (M = 4.05, SD = 0.90) reported being comfortable with and trusting AI platforms for recommendations regarding their future career paths and development. Notably, no significant difference was found between male and female undergraduate students (males: M = 3.91, SD = 0.86; females: M = 3.90, SD = 0.83) and postgraduate students (female: M = 4.08, SD = 0.85; male: M = 3.95, SD = 1.10) regarding their perception of the effectiveness, importance, and satisfaction with personalized career guidance services. However, participants reported low satisfaction with current career guidance and significant challenges in accessing information about programs during the application process. Given these findings, we recommend the development of accessible, user-friendly, and adaptable AI platforms that address the specific needs of the current and future Nigerian workforce. We also recommend that government agencies, policymakers, and private sector organizations collaborate to facilitate the development of these AI-driven career-guidance platforms. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.78,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02474,How do Chinese undergraduates harness the potential of appraisal and emotions in generative AI-Powered learning? A multigroup analysis based on appraisal theory,"The rapid development of generative AI (GenAI) has sparked increasing interest in its potential impact on student learning. Drawing on cognitive appraisal theory and AI device use acceptance (AIDUA) model, this study aims to investigate the complex dynamics of GenAI adoption among university undergraduates. Especially, our study examined how social, personal, and technological factors (social influence, hedonic motivation, and anthropomorphism) contributed to their cognitive appraisal and emotional experience with GenAI, analyzed how these cognitive- emotional responses affected their GenAI-powered learning productivity, and explored how this influential mechanism differs across various groups. We surveyed 2,026 Chinese undergraduates who had used GenAI in their studies. The findings indicated that the influence from others on using GenAI and hedonic motivation toward using GenAI were positively related to undergraduates' appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge and negatively related to their view of it as a hindrance. Conversely, the anthropomorphic features of GenAI showed the opposite pattern. Undergraduates who viewed using GenAI as a challenge reported more positive emotions and demonstrated higher GenAI-powered learning productivity. Those who saw it as a hindrance experienced more negative emotions but showed no significant relationship with GenAI-powered learning productivity. Moreover, undergraduate students' appraisal of using GenAI as a challenge or a hindrance and their emotional experiences played mediating roles in this influential process. Importantly, these relationships varied significantly across different student groups, highlighting the need for tailored approaches in GenAI integration.

REC_09466,"Chatting Heavily with ChatGPT: Investigating Usefulness, Privacy, Integrity, Ease, and Intention as Drivers of Technology Acceptance Among Business Communication Students","Teachers, students, and professionals widely use ChatGPT for business communication. Recent studies have explored predictors driving its adoption, predominantly from a general education perspective. To address this gap, this study examines predictors and barriers encountered by English for Specific Purposes (ESP) learners in India, a developing market with a significant number of ChatGPT users enrolled in business communication (BC) courses. A model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) was proposed, incorporating seven predictors to assess their influence on the intention to use ChatGPT. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was performed on 526 students' responses from two reputed Indian private universities, yielding a good model fit (minimum discrepancy by degree of freedom = 2.95, goodness of fit index [GFI] = 0.945, root mean square error of approximation [RMSEA] = 0.043). Further, the results identified five significant predictors: perceived usefulness (beta = 0.234, p < 0.001), academic integrity (beta = 0.291, p = 0.003), perceived ease of participation (beta = 0.174, p = 0.013), privacy concerns (beta = 0.224, p = 0.004), and perceived ease of participation's effect on perceived usefulness (beta = 0.354, p < 0.001). However, peer behavior (beta = -0.032, p = 0.769) and security concerns (beta = -0.059, p = 0.434) were found to be insignificant predictors. The findings suggest that ChatGPT adoption is shaped by perceived functionality, ethical confidence, ease of use, and privacy assurance, while peer behavior and security concerns play a limited role, likely due to the tool's early-stage adoption and individualistic usage patterns.

REC_03902,Immersive technologies and academic performance in online learning: A sequential mediation analysis,"Despite rapid advancement in immersive technologies within online and distance learning environments, fundamental questions remain about their transformative mechanisms in higher education. This study develops and validates a sequential mediation model explaining how immersive technologies improve academic outcomes by integrating Technology Acceptance Model, Constructivist Learning Theory, Cognitive Load Theory, and Adaptive Learning Theory and quality education. Using cross-sectional design with stratified random sampling, data were collected from 245 Indonesian vocational higher education institutions representing five geographic regions. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling analyzed hypothesized relationships through bootstrapping procedures with 5000 resamples. Results support all five hypotheses with varying effect magnitudes: Online & Distance Learning demonstrates large effect on Academic Performance (f2 = 0.463), Learning Experience shows medium effect on Immersive Technologies adoption (f2 = 0.286), while direct effects of Learning Experience and Immersive Technologies on Academic Performance show small but significant effects. The integrated model explains 71.6 % variance in Academic Performance and 57.8 % in Immersive Technologies, with strong predictive relevance (Q2 = 0.520, 0.359 respectively). Mediation analysis reveals Immersive Technologies partially mediate Learning Experience-Academic Performance relationship (VAF = 25.1 %, p = 0.038). Findings provide evidence-based guidance for educational technology implementation in resource-constrained environments, recommending prioritization of foundational digital infrastructure before advanced immersive technology investments while highlighting the importance of cultural adaptation in technology adoption processes, and product innovation.

REC_02477,Enhancing blended learning discussions with a Scaffolded Knowledge Integration-Based ChatGPT mobile instant messaging system,"Recent expansions in the use of ChatGPT within mobile instant messaging (MIM) platforms have garnered attention for their potential to enrich blended learning discussions. However, existing implementations often prioritize quick answers rather than pedagogically structured scaffolds, potentially limiting deeper learning. In this study, we introduce SKIMIM (Scaffolded Knowledge Integration-Based ChatGPT Mobile Instant Messaging), a system designed to systematically incorporate Scaffolded Knowledge Integration framework into AI-supported discussions. SKIMIM prompts learners to elicit their initial ideas, add new concepts, distinguish among different points of view, and reflect to refine their understanding. A 15-week randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted with 87 master's students assigned to three groups: SKIMIM, standard ChatGPTMIM, and traditional MIM. Data were collected through engagement questionnaires, discussion logs, and semi-structured interviews, and analyzed via a mixed-methods approach covering behavioral, cognitive, and emotional dimensions of engagement, as well as user perceptions grounded in an extended Technology Acceptance Model. The results revealed that while standard ChatGPT-MIM provided higher behavioral participation and emotional comfort through rapid AI assistance, SKIMIM significantly enhanced cognitive engagement-particularly by fostering sense-making and innovation-level thinking. Although students experienced an initial adjustment period with SKIMIM's structured prompts, they ultimately reported comparable behavioral intention to use, along with notably higher perceived learning effectiveness and discussion quality. These findings underscore the importance of integrating AI with deliberate scaffolding strategies to achieve both active engagement and deeper cognitive outcomes in blended learning discussions.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,include,0.0,0.55,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09483,Understanding Generative Artificial Intelligence Adoption in Puerto Rican Medical Schools: A Cross-Institutional Survey of First- and Second-Year Students,"Background Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has rapidly gained traction in medical education, yet little is known about its use among medical students in Puerto Rico. This study examines GenAI usage patterns among first- and second-year students across all four Liaison Committee on Medical Education-accredited medical schools in Puerto Rico, with comparisons based on user experience. Methods A cross-institutional electronic survey was conducted from January to June 2024 among first- and second-year medical students (n = 194) from Ponce Health Sciences University, University of Puerto Rico Medical Sciences Campus, San Juan Bautista School of Medicine, and Universidad Central del Caribe. Students were grouped by program year, and GenAI experience (<1 year vs >= 1 year). Chi-square tests were used to evaluate group differences (P < 0.05). Results Of the 778 first- and second-year medical students enrolled across all schools, 194 responded. Most (72.7%) reported using GenAI, primarily ChatGPT (89.9%), mainly for academic purposes (75.3%). Students with >= 1 year of GenAI experience were more likely to agree that GenAI helped them understand research papers (89.9%) compared to 51.6% of less-experienced users who disagreed (P < 0.001). From this same cohort, 72.7% also planned to use GenAI for board exam preparation, compared to 63.2% of less-experienced users who did not plan to use it. Although 72.2% believe GenAI will be integrated into Puerto Rico's healthcare system, only 52.1% felt that local medical facilities would be receptive. Challenges such as limited data access (27%) and power outages (34%) were more commonly reported by less-experienced users. Conclusion Generative AI adoption among Puerto Rican medical students is expanding, mainly for academic purposes. Greater experience correlates with higher perceived benefit, emphasizing the need for structured, ethical GenAI training, and institutional support within medical education.",2025,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.88,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03938,University EFL instructors' engagement with generative AI: A cross-cultural analysis,"Anchored in a framework that merges the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with Sociocultural Theory (SCT), this study investigates how university EFL instructors in Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Mexico, and Turkey are integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools into their practice. The analysis moved beyond the simplistic view that technology uniformly enhances learning. Instead, it considered pedagogical beliefs, individual attitudes toward GenAI, the perceived strength of institutional support, the level of trust in the tools, and the core TAM constructs. A cross-sectional survey data from 307 instructors, 210 of whom indicated they were actively deploying GenAI in their classes, were analyzed. Results uncovered cross-national variation in pedagogical orientation and institutional affordances. Mexican and Turkish participants tended to favor constructivist approaches, while Saudi and Egyptian colleagues were more rooted in transmissive pedagogies. Constructivist orientations were consistently linked to higher ratings of perceived utility and ease of use. Attitudes toward GenAI proved to be the strongest predictor of intention to use, which, together with perceived usefulness, also predicted actual classroom use. In contrast, perceived trust and institutional support did not manifest as direct drivers of use, highlighting a gap between what instructors intend and what they enact. By merging TAM cognitive orientation with SCT emphasis on the wider sociocultural setting, the research contributes a layered understanding of the factors shaping GenAI uptake in EFL settings. The findings underscore a mix of opportunities and challenges, stressing the need for belief-sensitive professional development, culturally responsive policies, and ethically informed design of AI tools for language education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.71,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01916,Impact of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of humanoid robots on students' intention to use,"The rapid progress of artificial intelligence (AI) has spurred significant changes in education, highlighting the need to explore students' perceptions and acceptance of AI-driven educational tools like humanoid robots. This study builds on an extended version of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), incorporating students' individual traits such as novelty-seeking and self-efficacy. Data was collected from 508 undergraduate students in mainland China through a survey, and analyzed using SPSS 23.0 and SmartPLS 4.0. The results show that novelty-seeking positively impacts perceived usefulness, while self-efficacy significantly enhances perceived ease of use. Both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness are strong predictors of students' attitudes, which in turn influence their behavioral intentions to use humanoid robots in educational settings. The study enriches the TAM framework by integrating individual differences, providing new theoretical perspectives on technology acceptance in education. It also offers practical implications for education technology developers, educators, and policymakers, such as designing services according to students' personality traits, focusing on students with high self-efficacy for promotion, and highlighting the advantages of humanoid robots.

REC_03981,Drivers of generative AI adoption in higher education through the lens of the Theory of Planned Behaviour,"Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this study investigates the relationship between the perceived benefits, strengths, weaknesses, and risks of generative AI (GenAI) tools and the fundamental factors of the TPB model (i.e., attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control). The study also investigates the structural association between the TPB variables and intention to use GenAI tools, and how the latter might affect the actual usage of GenAI tools in higher education. The paper adopts a quantitative approach, relying on an anonymous self-administered online questionnaire to gather primary data from 130 lecturers and 168 students in higher education institutions (HEIs) in several countries, and PLS-SEM for data analysis. The results indicate that although lecturers' and students' perceptions of the risks and weaknesses of GenAI tools differ, the perceived strengths and advantages of GenAI technologies have a significant and positive impact on their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioural control. The TPB core variables positively and significantly impact lecturers' and students' intentions to use GenAI tools, which in turn significantly and positively impact their adoption of such tools. This paper advances theory by outlining the factors shaping the adoption of GenAI technologies in HEIs. It provides stakeholders with a variety of managerial and policy implications for how to formulate suitable rules and regulations to utilise the advantages of these tools while mitigating the impacts of their disadvantages.

REC_12764,Enhancing the use of artificial intelligence in architectural education - case study Saudi Arabia,"In the present study, we explored the ways in which Artificial Intelligence (AI) is currently integrated into architectural education in Saudi Arabia, a country undergoing rapid digital and educational transformation. Our main goal was to identify major factors that drive the adoption of AI in the Saudi architectural education. To this end, we analyzed both architecture students' and faculty members' awareness, usage, and perceptions of AI. Our particular focus was on divergencies in the perspectives of these two groups. To this end, a survey was conducted among a total of 160 architecture students and 32 faculty members of the Department of Islamic Architecture at Umm Al-Qura University. The collected data were analyzed using both descriptive and inferential statistics, including regression analysis. The results revealed significant differences between students and faculty in terms of their AI awareness and usage. Specifically, while the surveyed students reported experiencing strong enthusiasm and demonstrated familiarity with AI tools, the participant faculty members were hesitant about using AI in architecture learning contexts, voicing particular concerns about an over-reliance on AI that can, from their perspective, compromise students' creativity. However, despite the aforementioned differences, and acknowledging the urgent need for training programs and workshops aimed at enhancing students' AI-related skills, both groups agreed on the importance of integrating AI in architectural education in the future. Based on these findings, we conclude with a set of recommendations aimed at increasing AI engagement in architectural curricula, with a particular emphasis on various skill development initiatives that could provide both architecture students and faculty with a better understanding of how AI can support and promote creativity in learning and teaching architectural design.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.65,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01928,The impact of personality traits and AI literacy on the adoption intentions of AI among design faculty in Chinese higher education,"This study utilizes a dual-perspective framework that integrates stable individual differences (Big Five personality traits) and developable technological competencies (AI literacy). Drawing on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) and Innovation Resistance Theory (IRT), it constructs both a cognitive empowerment pathway and a psychological resistance pathway to systematically reveal the behavioral intention mechanisms underlying the adoption of AI in teaching by design faculty in Chinese higher education institutions. Based on 513 valid survey responses, the research applies a mixed-methods approach. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) results demonstrate that: 1) Openness (OPE), Extraversion (EXT), and AI literacy significantly and positively influence perceived behavioral control (PBC), while EXT and Agreeableness (AGR) significantly reduce psychological barriers (PB), collectively enhancing usage intention (UI); 2) Neuroticism (NEU) has a negative impact on PBC and a positive effect on PB, which consequently inhibits UI; 3) OPE, AGR, and AI literacy are significant positive predictors of UI, whereas NEU has a significant negative relationship with UI. The Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) further identifies complex configurational effects between Big Five personality traits (BFP) and AI literacy, revealing eight discrete causal pathways leading to high AI usage intention among design educators, which stands in contrast to some SEM results. This study provides a systematic examination of how individual differences affect AI adoption behaviors among design faculty in Chinese higher education from an interdisciplinary perspective, thereby expanding the theoretical framework in this domain and offering empirical evidence and practical recommendations for capacity-building in AI-enabled teaching among design educators in China.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.76,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Aim: To evaluate the predictive effect of nursing students' attitudes and acceptance of artificial intelligence on their clinical competencies. Methods: This descriptive-correlational study was conducted at 2 universities (February-June 2024) with 441 nursing students. Full-time students in clinical practice participated; those absent or on leave were excluded. The Nursing Students Competency Scale, General Attitudes to Artificial Intelligence Scale, and Generative Artificial Intelligence Acceptance Scale were used. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used. Results: The main factors affecting nursing students' clinical competence were facilitating conditions, social influence, and negative attitudes toward AI. A weak correlation was found between positive AI attitudes and acceptance, which explained 8.6% of the competency levels. Conclusion: Positive perceptions of AI may increase competence, while skepticism may deepen engagement and critical learning. Strategies to improve the acceptance and use of AI are crucial to maximize its benefits in nursing education and practice. (c) 2025 Organization for Associate Degree Nursing.

REC_01931,The psychology of AI adoption in education: University students' intentions to use Large Language Models for learning from a TAM and TPB perspective,"The rapid rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and the exponential growth of AI-based tools, particularly LLMs, have spurred extensive global research in recent years. In the education sector, LLMs have demonstrated their potential to enhance students' learning experiences and contribute to improved academic performance. In Vietnam, while recent studies have explored university students' perceptions of using LLMs in learning, there is a notable research gap regarding their actual adoption of these tools for educational purposes. Therefore, this research was conducted to address this gap by investigating the intentions to adopt LLMs for learning by university students, applying the extended Technology Adoption Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) models. The study employed a non-probability convenience sampling approach to gather data from 226 university students in Vietnam who have prior experiences in adapting LLMs for their learning. Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to test the hypotheses and to evaluate the research model. The findings revealed that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and perceived trust in LLMs significantly and positively influence students' attitudes toward adoption. Moreover, all TPB constructs-attitude, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control-positively impact intention to use LLMs, with subjective norms having the strongest effect. These findings underscore the critical role of social influence in shaping students' adoption behavior within this cultural context. This study contributes to theory by demonstrating the importance of incorporating cultural elements, such as subjective norms, into adoption models. Practically, it provides clear guidance for educators and policymakers to promote LLM integration through peer-led strategies and the cultivation of positive social norms around AI use in education. Ultimately, the study highlights that fostering a supportive and socially endorsed environment is key to encouraging effective adoption of AI technologies in learning.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10096,A multidimensional study of AI adoption among University students in teacher education programs,"The purpose of this study is to determine the factors that affect students' successful and efficient usage of AI in Austrian teacher education programs. To achieve this, a multi-perspective approach was used, combining MAILS, ISS, and TAM3 frameworks. To evaluate the research model, CB-SEM was employed to analyze data collected from 254 students. The results showed that performance outcomes of AI use positively influence perceived ease of AI use, perceived usefulness of AI, and practical application of AI, but not AI attitudes and students' satisfaction with AI. Although AI ethics does not affect perceived ease of AI use and AI usefulness, it positively influences practical application of AI. Technological complexity of AI negatively impacts perceived ease of AI use, but its influence on perceived usefulness of AI, AI attitudes, AI satisfaction, and AI practical application is insignificant. While both perceived usefulness of AI and ease of AI use positively influence AI attitudes and AI satisfaction, perceived ease of AI use does not influence AI satisfaction. Interestingly, AI attitudes and AI perceived usefulness positively influence AI satisfaction, but AI attitudes do not affect AI practical application. Finally, students' satisfaction with AI positively influences AI practical application.

REC_10129,Generative AI and the future of higher education: a threat to academic integrity or reformation? Evidence from multicultural perspectives,"In recent years, higher education (HE) globally has witnessed extensive adoption of technology, particularly in teaching and research. The emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) further accelerates this trend. However, the increasing sophistication of GenAI tools has raised concerns about their potential to automate teaching and research processes. Despite widespread research on GenAI in various fields, there is a lack of multicultural perspectives on its impact and concerns in HE. This study addresses this gap by examining the usage, benefits, and concerns of GenAI in higher education from a multicultural standpoint. We employed an online survey that collected responses from 1217 participants across 76 countries, encompassing a broad range of gender categories, academic disciplines, geographical locations, and cultural orientations. Our findings revealed a high level of awareness and familiarity with GenAI tools among respondents. A significant portion had prior experience and expressed the intention to continue using these tools, primarily for information retrieval and text paraphrasing. The study emphasizes the importance of GenAI integration in higher education, highlighting both its potential benefits and concerns. Notably, there is a strong correlation between cultural dimensions and respondents' views on the benefits and concerns related to GenAI, including its potential as academic dishonesty and the need for ethical guidelines. We, therefore, argued that responsible use of GenAI tools can enhance learning processes, but addressing concerns may require robust policies that are responsive to cultural expectations. We discussed the findings and offered recommendations for researchers, educators, and policymakers, aiming to promote the ethical and effective integration of GenAI tools in higher education.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

However, the impact of the perceived embodiment of such characters in language learning videos on students' technology acceptance and adoption is unclear. Integrating structural equation modeling into thematic analysis, this study analyzes 1042 valid responses from higher education students to bridge this research gap. Our study reveals that four subdimensions of embodiment (human-likeness, credibility, learning facilitation, and engagement) significantly and positively predict higher-education students' perceived ease of use and usefulness of artificial intelligence-generated virtual teachers in language learning videos. Notably, an exception arises, as human-likeness does not significantly predict students' perceived ease of use in our research context. Students' perceived systemic interactivity and impact on the learning process emerge as pivotal mediators. The qualitative thematic analysis identifies students' concerns about classroom administration, developmental support, technical issues, deprived interpersonal collaboration, and liberal attainment cultivation with the virtual teacher presence.

REC_10134,Artificial intelligence and communication technologies in academia: faculty perceptions and the adoption of generative AI,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is ushering in an era of potential transformation in various fields, especially in educational communication technologies, with tools like ChatGPT and other generative AI (GenAI) applications. This rapid proliferation and adoption of GenAI tools have sparked significant interest and concern among college professors, who are dealing with evolving dynamics in digital communication within the classroom. Yet, the effect and implications of GenAI in education remain understudied. Therefore, this study employs the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Social Cognitive Theory (SCT) as theoretical frameworks to explore higher education faculty's perceptions, attitudes, usage, and motivations, as the underlying factors that influence their adoption or rejection of GenAI tools. A survey was conducted among full-time higher education faculty members (N = 294) recruited from two mid-size public universities in the US. Results found that college professors' perceived usefulness of AI predicted their attitudes and intention to use and adopt the technology, more than their perceived ease of use. Trust and social reinforcement strongly influenced college professors' GenAI adoption decisions and acted as significant mediators to better understand the relationship between TAM and SCT. Findings emphasized the power of social dynamics in shaping professors' self-efficacy, attitudes, and use of GenAI. Trust enhances peer influence and affects how perceived usefulness shapes users' willingness to adopt technology, whereas self-efficacy has a minimal impact.

This study, merging the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with the Protection Motivation Theory (PMT), explores the relationship between technology adoption and protection motivation in higher education, addressing the concept of the (un)knowledgeable, the (un)skilled. Through Structural Equation Modeling, findings from Indonesian participants (N = 445), including students and lecturers, reveal that perceived benefits such as task efficiency, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and effort expectancy predominantly motivate Chat-GPT use. Risk perception leans more on perceived vulnerability than severity, with insignificant impact from response cost. Response efficacy and self-efficacy significantly determine intention. Insight from moderating effect of educational level suggest that doctoral-level users demonstrate increased Chat-GPT usage, and gender plays a role in response efficacy and task efficiency. Both educational level and gender actively influence users' intentions and actual usage behavior. These insights guide educators, policymakers, and institutions in ethically integrating AI, managing evolving risk perceptions, and empowering users in the dynamic AI landscape of higher education.

REC_10137,In GenAI we trust: An investigation of university students' reliance on and resistance to generative AI in language learning,"Advances in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) have the potential to transform learning. As research increasingly calls for transforming the human-GenAI relationship from mere tool use to a collaborative partnership, there remains a notable gap in exploring an important factor influencing this relationship: trust in GenAI, being crucial amidst growing concerns about disuse, misuse, and abuse of GenAI in learner-GenAI interaction primarily via language. This study seeks to address the gap by investigating university students' trust in GenAI, its related factors of reliance and resistance, and boundary conditions in using GenAI for language learning. The research utilized an explanatory sequential mixed-methods design. In Study 1, a proposed conceptual model within the stimulus-organism-response framework was quantitatively tested through structural equation modeling using a survey. Data were collected from 682 university students who used GenAI in language learning. Study 2 further confirmed the results through 40 qualitative interviews and refined the conceptual model by offering a deeper understanding of the relationships. The findings indicate that trust in GenAI is a significant factor in university students' use of GenAI for language learning, with its influence on behavioral intention to use mediated through reliance and resistance. Moreover, forms of the five factors are identified: trust in GenAI, reliance, resistance, perceived risk, and actual use. Additionally, two boundary conditions are identified: perceived risk between trust in GenAI and reliance/resistance, and self-directed learning between behavioral intention to use and actual use. These findings provide theoretical, research, and practical implications regarding the appropriate use of GenAI in education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.82,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11866,"Utilization of, Perceptions on, and Intention to Use AI Chatbots Among Medical Students in China: National Cross-Sectional Study","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are poised to have a profound impact on medical education. Medical students, as early adopters of technology and future health care providers, play a crucial role in shaping the future of health care. However, little is known about the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use AI chatbots among medical students in China. Objective: This study aims to explore the utilization of, perceptions on, and intention to use generative AI chatbots among medical students in China, using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework. By conducting a national cross-sectional survey, we sought to identify the key determinants that influence medical students' acceptance of AI chatbots, thereby providing a basis for enhancing their integration into medical education. Understanding these factors is crucial for educators, policy makers, and technology developers to design and implement effective AI-driven educational tools that align with the needs and expectations of future health care professionals. Methods: A web-based electronic survey questionnaire was developed and distributed via social media to medical students across the country. The UTAUT was used as a theoretical framework to design the questionnaire and analyze the data. The relationship between behavioral intention to use AI chatbots and UTAUT predictors was examined using multivariable regression. Results: A total of 693 participants were from 57 universities covering 21 provinces or municipalities in China. Only a minority (199/693, 28.72%) reported using AI chatbots for studying, with ChatGPT (129/693, 18.61%) being the most commonly used. Most of the participants used AI chatbots for quickly obtaining medical information and knowledge (631/693, 91.05%) and increasing learning efficiency (594/693, 85.71%). Utilization behavior, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risk, and personal innovativeness showed significant positive associations with the behavioral intention to use AI Conclusions: Chinese medical students hold positive perceptions toward and high intentions to use AI chatbots, but there are gaps between intention and actual adoption. This highlights the need for strategies to improve access, training, and support and provide peer usage examples to fully harness the potential benefits of chatbot technology.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.67,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10142,Promoting student engagement with GPTutor: An intelligent tutoring system powered by generative AI,"Intelligent Tutoring Systems (ITS) are computer systems that mimic human tutoring behavior while providing immediate feedback. With the rise of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), numerous ITS integrated with GenAI have been developed. Student engagement is critical for improving learning processes and outcomes. Therefore, it is important to examine the effectiveness of ITS integrated with GenAI in promoting student engagement in educational practice. This paper presents an explanatory mixed-method case study involving 880 undergraduate students who used GPTutor, an ITS powered by GenAI. First, a survey research was conducted to investigate the relationship between students' actual interaction with GPTutor and their self-reported student engagement from three dimensions: Behavioral Engagement, Cognitive Engagement, and Emotional Engagement. Next, focus groups were conducted with a subsample of survey participants to better understand how and under what circumstances GPTutor improved student engagement. The focus groups also explored potential design improvements for GPTutor and other ITS powered by GenAI. The results of the survey research revealed a complex relationship between feature usage and student engagement. Specifically, engagement with the chatbot is significantly and positively associated with behavioral and emotional engagement, but not cognitive engagement. The exercise generator feature had no significant associations with any of the three dimensions of student engagement. The results of the focus groups shed some light on these relationships, revealing how GPTutor was used only when it was perceived as useful, and this perceived usefulness was shaped by the students' perception of the difficulty of the course and whether their support system could adequately address questions they may have. Its usefulness was found to increase as the course progressed, particularly as examinations approached. As the examinations approached, it was increasingly clear that the exercise generator was preferred over the chatbot. The participants also made this clear by expressing how GPTutor could be improved, notably by increasing the capabilities of the chatbot to include multimodal media, like video recordings of lectures. In general, leveraging survey data, interview data, and back-end trace data from GenAI, this research makes an original contribution to AI-supported effective learning environments and design strategies to optimize the educational experiences of higher education students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.85,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12850,Motivational and appraisal factors shaping generative AI use and intention in Austrian higher education students and teachers,"This study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to examine factors influencing generative AI (genAI) use among Austrian higher education students (n = 3,094) and teachers (n = 1,767). We applied confirmatory structural equation modeling (SEM) to replicate prior evidence on performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence, and introduced partial least squares SEM (PLS-SEM) to examine challenge and threat appraisals as additional predictors. Behavioral intention strongly predicted genAI use (beta = 0.75, p < 0.001 for students; beta = 0.48, p < 0.001 for teachers), with performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and social influence as key positive predictors. Effort expectancy was particularly salient for teachers, reflecting time constraints. Gender differences emerged primarily among students: females reported lower subjective competence, intrinsic motivation, and challenge appraisals, but higher threat appraisals; differences were weaker in teachers. Linear regression analyses showed that challenge appraisals-predicted by intrinsic motivation, trust in genAI, and genAI-related subjective competence-positively influenced behavioral intention, whereas threat appraisals had a small negative impact (beta approximate to -0.03). The extended model explained substantial variance in behavioral intention (R-2 approximate to 0.8) and genAI use (students R-2 = 0.34; teachers R-2 = 0.18). These findings highlight the importance of aligning AI integration with user needs, motivation, and affective responses to support meaningful and ethical genAI adoption in higher education.

REC_12853,Adoption intention of generative artificial intelligence among Chinese college students: an extended TAM-UTAUT2 model from the four-helix perspective,"To explore the formation mechanism of college students' adoption intention of generative artificial intelligence (GAI)-i.e., the dynamic paths of direct/indirect effects of antecedent variables and interaction effects of moderating variables-this study integrates and extends the traditional Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2). The integration is necessary because traditional TAM focuses on rational cognition, while UTAUT2 lacks the emotional dimension in educational scenarios and the integration of multi-level contexts. A theoretical framework incorporating the individual-family- institution-region four-dimensional moderating and collaborative perspective was constructed, and an empirical analysis was conducted using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). A multi-stage stratified sampling method was adopted, with a sample of 842 college students from five universities in eastern and western China. The scales for UTAUT2 core variables and extended TAM variables in the questionnaire were adapted from previous studies that had undergone reliability and validity verification. Reliability was tested using Cronbach's alpha and Composite Reliability, while validity was tested using Average Variance Extracted, the Fornell-Larcker criterion, and Heterotrait-Monotrait Ratio. Results showed that the measurement model had acceptable reliability and validity, with good explanatory power (R-2 = 0.743) and predictive validity of the structural model. Specifically, perceived comfort (beta = 0.112, p < 0.005), perceived security (beta = 0.109, p < 0.05), and emotional dependence (beta = 0.497, p < 0.005) all exerted positive effects on perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Performance expectancy (beta = 0.216, p < 0.005), social influence (beta = -0.064, p < 0.05), facilitating conditions (beta = 0.143, p < 0.005), and perceived ease of use (beta = 0.469, p < 0.005) directly drove adoption intention, whereas the direct effect of perceived usefulness was not significant (beta = -0.031, p = 0.523). This result challenges the core assumption of TAM-which emphasizes priority of rational utility and confirms the de- instrumentalization characteristic of generative AI adoption, meaning user decisions rely more on emotional experience and interactive fluency.Regarding moderating effects: gender negatively moderated the relationship between performance expectancy and adoption intention (beta = -0.207, p < 0.05); family structure negatively moderated the relationship between habit and adoption intention (beta = -0.228, p < 0.05); university type positively moderated the relationship between performance expectancy and adoption intention (beta = 0.251, p < 0.05); and regional differences negatively moderated this relationship (beta = -0.251, p < 0.05).In practice, it is suggested that educational authorities strengthen the construction of digital infrastructure in western universities, universities develop differentiated guidance strategies for students majoring in humanities/social sciences and science/engineering, and developers optimize emotional interaction design.

Data were analyzed using covariance-based structural equation modeling (CB-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to capture both linear and configurational relationships among variables.Results Findings show that perceived usefulness, ease of use, and enjoyment significantly predict DeepSeek adoption. Adoption, in turn, is associated with increased happiness and reduced stress but shows no significant effect on faculty energy. The combination of TAM and fsQCA approaches revealed multiple sufficient pathways leading to positive well-being outcomes, emphasizing the importance of usability and hedonic motivation.Discussion The study extends the Technology Acceptance Model by incorporating emotional and contextual drivers of adoption.

REC_02174,Exploring the role of intrinsic motivation in ChatGPT adoption to support active learning: An extension of the technology acceptance model,"Background: ChatGPT, a powerful artificial intelligence chatbot, has great potential for active learning because of its ability to generate instant responses to academic inquiries and foster spontaneous interactions. Purpose: This exploratory study investigated the roles of intrinsic motivation and factors of the technology acceptance model that influence ChatGPT acceptance for active learning among undergraduates in Hong Kong. Method: Using a structural equation modeling approach, we examined the extended technology acceptance model in the context of higher education. Using self-report questionnaires, we obtained useful responses from 473 undergraduate students in Hong Kong in July 2023. The reliability and validity of the data were measured using confirmatory factor analysis, followed by path analysis to investigate the hypotheses in the proposed model. Results: We identified intrinsic motivation as the strongest motivator for ChatGPT use intention. Consistent with the prior literature on technology acceptance, perceived usefulness was found to be a strong predictor of behavioral intention. In contrast to extant research, the findings indicate no significant relationship between perceived ease of use and behavioral intention. Neither perceived usefulness nor perceived ease of use were significant mediators in the relationship between intrinsic motivation and behavioral intention. Conclusion: These findings highlight the significant effect of intrinsic motivation on ChatGPT acceptance in supporting students' active learning. They also provide inspiration for ChatGPT developers and educationalists regarding the importance of intrinsic and extrinsic motivation (perceived usefulness) in promoting the broader acceptance of chatbots in the educational context. Efforts should be made to improve students' positive subjective experiences and the response quality of ChatGPT.",2023,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

A proposed model based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology model-2 (UTAUT2) was used in the context of the study. A pilot study was done prior to the main data collection to examine the reliability of the instrument. For the structural model assessment, 1117 responses were analyzed through Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Importance-Performance Analysis (IPMA). Most hypotheses are confirmed by the significant results reported through the PLS-SEM. The strongest determinant of Behavioral Intention (BI) to use ChatGPT in learning was Facilitating Conditions (FC). ChatGPT use (GPTU) was most significantly predicted by BI. However, one hypothesis was not supported; the insignificant role of Effort Expectancy (EE) on BI was revealed. Through IPMA, FC had the most significant importance for BI, while BI was the most important determinant for GPTU. Besides, BI obtains the highest performance in the IPMA procedure.

REC_10258,New Challenges of Learning Accounting With Artificial Intelligence: The Role of Innovation and Trust in Technology,"Online learning has become increasingly popular, making the learning process more attractive. One of the most popular learning media is artificial intelligence (AI). However, students do not accept this technology at all. Therefore, this study examined the factors influencing accounting students' acceptance of AI in learning. The survey was conducted with 147 higher-education students who use AI as a learning medium. The data were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0 with the partial least square approach. The results showed that perceived usefulness influenced behavioral intention to use and satisfaction. However, perceived ease of use was only significant for satisfaction. Similarly, perceived confidence must be consistent with intention. Although it may influence perceived usefulness, other constructs, such as AI quality and personal innovativeness, can increase students' perceptions of the benefits and convenience of adopting AI in learning. Thus, this study contributes to the development of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the information systems success model and is helpful to scholars, especially in applying AI in learning. They need to pay attention to the quality of AI, such as the accuracy of the information produced. Thus, the need to control the information from the AI only serves as a reference without requiring you to trust it completely. © 2024 The Author(s).",2024,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.72,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05478,Understanding the impact of knowledge management factors on the sustainable use of AI-based chatbots for educational purposes using a hybrid SEM-ANN approach,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based chatbots have received considerable attention during the last few years. However, little is known concerning what affects their use for educational purposes. This research, therefore, develops a theoretical model based on extracting constructs from the expectation confirmation model (ECM) (expectation confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction), combined with the knowledge management (KM) factors (knowledge sharing, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge application) to understand the sustainable use of chatbots. The developed model was then tested based on data collected through an online survey from 448 university students who used chatbots for learning purposes. Contrary to the prior literature that mainly relied on structural equation modeling (SEM) techniques, the empirical data were analyzed using a hybrid SEM-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach. The hypotheses testing results reinforced all the suggested hypotheses in the developed model. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that knowledge application has the most considerable effect on the sustainable use of chatbots with 96.9% normalized importance, followed by perceived usefulness (70.7%), knowledge acquisition (69.3%), satisfaction (61%), and knowledge sharing (19.6%).

REC_10260,"Students’ Perceptions of ChatGPT in Higher Education: A Study of Academic Enhancement, Procrastination, and Ethical Concerns","The integration of AI tools in education is reshaping how students view and interact with their learning experiences. As AI usage continues to grow, it becomes increasingly important to understand how students' perceptions of AI technology impact their academic performance and learning behaviours. To investigate these effects, we conducted a correlational study with a sample of 44 students to examine the relationship between students' perceptions of ChatGPT’s utility—focusing on usage frequency, perceived usefulness, accuracy, reliability, and time efficiency—and key academic outcomes, including content mastery, confidence in knowledge, and grade improvement. Additionally, we explored how these perceptions influence student behaviours, such as reliance on ChatGPT, procrastination tendencies, and the potential risk of plagiarism. The canonical correlation analysis revealed a statistically significant relationship between students' perceptions of ChatGPT's utility and their academic outcomes. Students who viewed ChatGPT as reliable and efficient tended to report higher grades, improved understanding of the material, and greater confidence in their knowledge. Furthermore, the bivariate correlation analysis revealed a significant relationship between dependency on ChatGPT and procrastination (r = 0.546, p < .001), indicating that a higher reliance on AI tools may contribute to increased procrastination. No statistically significant association was identified between ChatGPT dependency and the risk of plagiarism. Future research should prioritize the development of strategies that promote the effective use of AI while minimizing the risk of over-reliance. Such efforts can enhance academic integrity and support independent learning. Educators play a critical role in this process by guiding students to balance the advantages of AI with the cultivation of critical thinking skills and adherence to ethical academic practices. © 2025 The Author(s).",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13762,Artificial Intelligence Tool Adoption in Higher Education: A Structural Equation Modeling Approach to Understanding Impact Factors among Economics Students,"The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in higher education has the potential to significantly enhance the educational process and student outcomes. However, there is a limited understanding of the factors influencing AI adoption among university students, particularly in economic programs. This study examines the relationship between students' perceptions of the efficacy and usefulness of AI tools, their access to these tools, and their concerns regarding AI usage. A comprehensive survey of Romanian university students, focusing on economics students, was undertaken. This study identifies critical latent factors and investigates their interrelationships by employing advanced analytical techniques, such as Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA), Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA), and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM), with robust standard errors. The results suggest that formal training and integration, concerns regarding AI, perceived utility, and positive attitudes towards AI are positively influenced by general awareness and familiarity with AI tools. The frequency of AI tool usage is substantially increased by perceived usefulness, positive attitudes, and formal training and integration. Conversely, positive attitudes and perceived utility are adversely affected by AI-related concerns. Indirect effects suggest that formal training and positive attitudes indirectly increase the usage frequency by increasing general awareness. This research is relevant to computer science, as it helps to build strategies to integrate AI technologies into educational processes.

This study explores university students' attitudes toward ChatGPT, focusing on the cognitive, affective, and behavioral components of attitudes, on the basis of Mitcham's philosophical framework of attitudes toward technology. A total of 595 university students from six public and private universities in northern Peru participated in an online survey. The results of the structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis revealed that the affective component ((3 = 0.672***) and the cognitive component ((3 = 0.260**) positively influence the behavioral component of students' attitudes when ChatGPT is used. Moreover, the cognitive component ((3 = 0.931***) positively influences the affective component of students' attitudes. However, gender and age did not have significant moderating effects on the relationships between the cognitive and affective components and the behavioral component. The discussion highlights that these findings contribute to understanding the psychological mechanisms underlying the adoption of ChatGPT in educational settings and offer valuable guidance for implementing this technology in teaching and learning processes. In conclusion, this study represents a significant advancement in comprehending attitudes toward generative AI technologies in higher education and opens new avenues for future research in this field.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.85,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01497,The interplay between Five-Factor personality traits and AI use motives in Turkish pre-service teachers: A canonical correlation analysis,"This study examines the multidimensional interplay between pre-service teachers' Five-Factor Personality Traits and their motivations for using artificial intelligence (AI) through Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA). While previous research has explored these variables independently, the complex multivariate relationships between personality traits and AI use motives have remained largely unexplored. The sample consisted of 454 undergraduate pre-service teachers. Data were collected using the Five-Factor Personality Traits Inventory and the Questionnaire of AI Use Motives. The analysis included five dimensions of personality traits (extraversion, neuroticism, openness, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) as predictor variables and five dimensions of AI use motives (expectancy, attainment value, utility value, intrinsic value, and cost) as criterion variables. The CCA yielded five functions, with the full model statistically significant (p <.001), explaining 32.6% of the shared variance. The first function was most meaningful, accounting for 26.1% of the variance. Primary contributors among personality traits were openness (rs = 0.83, rs(2) = 0.68), neuroticism (rs = - 0.63, rs(2) = 0.40), and conscientiousness (rs = 0.58, rs(2) = 0.34). For AI use motives, key contributors were attainment value (rs = 0.96, rs(2) = 0.92), cost (rs = - 0.85, rs(2) = 0.72), intrinsic value (rs = 0.84, rs(2) = 0.71), and utility value (rs = 0.80, rs(2) = 0.64). The canonical correlation coefficient (0.51) indicated a moderate relationship between the variable sets. Results revealed that openness was positively associated with intrinsic motivation for AI use, while neuroticism increased perceived costs. These findings suggest that teacher education programs should integrate personality-based AI training-such as creativity modules for open individuals and anxiety-reduction workshops for those high in neuroticism-within their digital pedagogy curriculum.",2025,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02188,"Exploring the paradoxical use of ChatGPT in education: Analyzing benefits, risks, and coping strategies through integrated UTAUT and PMT theories using a hybrid approach of SEM and fsQCA","ChatGPT's impact on education is both significant and inevitable, presenting a paradox of threats and benefits. While studies have explored ChatGPT's usage, intention, and motivation, few have addressed its paradoxical use from a benefit-risk-coping perspective, leaving gaps in practical and theoretical solutions. This study integrates the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to elucidate ChatGPT's paradoxical use in education. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and fuzzy sets Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA), it aims to provide insights and solutions for managing the benefits, risks, and coping mechanisms associated with ChatGPT in education. Hypotheses and propositions were tested on Taiwanese higher education users (N = 351). Findings from SEM confirm that the perceived threat of ChatGPT's severity decreases the intention to use it, while coping strategies such as self-efficacy and response efficacy strongly predict the intention to use ChatGPT. Additionally, the benefits of performance expectancy and task efficiency significantly increase the intention to use ChatGPT, which in turn significantly increases actual usage behavior. Findings from fsQCA reveal three configurations for both the usage and disusage of ChatGPT in education. The study identifies three constructs with necessary conditions. This research makes a significant theoretical contribution by integrating UTAUT and PMT into a unified framework to elucidate the paradoxical aspects of benefit-risk-coping in the use of ChatGPT. Practical implications for higher educational institutions and their scholars (e.g., students, lecturers, researchers) are also provided through confirmed solutions from the QCA model. These solutions offer strategic insights to leverage the benefits, identify the risks, and cope with the threats associated with using ChatGPT in education.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.75,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13342,The impact of Chinese undergraduates' perceived acceptance of AI technology on academic achievement: the mediating role of critical thinking,"Introduction: Although AI has become an integral part of university students' daily learning and career development, existing research rarely examines how students' acceptance of AI technology influences the cultivation of their critical thinking abilities. This study emphasizes the impact of Chinese undergraduates' perceived acceptance of AI technology (perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) on academic achievement, alongside the mediating role of critical thinking. Methods: Utilizing a questionnaire survey, this study targets undergraduate students in Chinese universities, surveying 549 participants from 4 universities in China. Results: According to our study results, perceived usefulness of AI technology significantly and positively impacts the academic achievement (beta = 0.117, p < 0.050) and critical thinking (beta = 0.332, p < 0.001); perceived ease of use of AI technology significantly and positively impacts the academic achievement (beta = 0.363, p < 0.001) and critical thinking, separately (beta = 0.313, p < 0.001); critical thinking significantly and positively impacts academic achievement (beta = 0.376, p < 0.001); critical thinking plays a partial mediating role between perceived usefulness of AI technology and academic achievement (0 is not included within the 95% confidence interval), and a full mediating role between perceived ease of use of AI technology and academic achievement (0 is not included within the 95% confidence interval). Discussion: All these results assist in more deeply comprehending learner behavior mechanisms in the era of generative AI, meanwhile contributing to theoretical support and practical insights for optimizing teaching strategies and enhancing talent development quality in universities under the context of intelligent technology.

REC_13780,Modeling Student Acceptance of AI Technologies in Higher Education: A Hybrid SEM-ANN Approach,"This study examines the role of different factors in supporting the sustainable use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies in higher education, particularly in the context of student interactions with intelligent and human-centered learning tools. Using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) within the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the research provides a detailed look at how trust influences students' attitudes and behaviors toward AI-based learning platforms. Data were gathered from 200 students at Occidental Mindoro State College to analyze the effects of social influence, self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, perceived risk, attitude toward use, behavioral intention, acceptance, and actual use. Results from SEM indicate that perceived risk and ease of use have a stronger impact on AI adoption than perceived usefulness and trust. The ANN analysis further shows that acceptance is the most important factor influencing actual AI use, reflecting the complex, non-linear relationships between trust, risk, and adoption. These findings highlight the need for AI systems that are adaptive, transparent, and designed with the user experience in mind. By building interfaces that are more intuitive and reliable, educators and designers can strengthen human-AI interaction and promote responsible and lasting integration of AI in education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.81,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13343,The impact mechanism of artificial intelligence dependence on college students' innovation capability: an empirical study from China,"Introduction The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education has increased college students' reliance on AI tools. While AI enhances learning efficiency, it may also undermine key cognitive processes required for innovation. Methods Using survey data from 1,032 students, this study employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to examine how AI dependence, cognitive inertia, employment pressure, and academic utilitarian atmosphere shape students' innovation capability. Results AI dependence significantly increases cognitive inertia, with cognitive dependence (beta = 0.570, p < 0.001) exerting a stronger effect than tool dependence (beta = 0.161, p < 0.001). Cognitive inertia reduces innovation capability (beta = -0.111, p < 0.001) and serves as a key mediator linking AI dependence to innovation. Employment pressure strengthens the positive effect of AI dependence on cognitive inertia (beta = 0.045, p < 0.05). A stronger academic utilitarian atmosphere further amplifies the negative impact of cognitive inertia on innovation capability (beta = 0.052, p < 0.05). The fsQCA results reveal multiple pathways to high innovation capability, with low cognitive inertia emerging as a core condition across all effective configurations. Discussion This study clarifies the cognitive mechanisms and contextual conditions through which AI dependence affects innovation. The findings extend research in educational technology and innovation psychology and offer practical guidance for universities to optimize learning environments, promote rational AI use, ease employment pressure, and improve academic culture.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,include,0.0,0.76,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13795,Assessing Medical Students' Perceptions of AI-Integrated Telemedicine: A Cross-Sectional Study in Romania,"Background and Objectives: The rapid advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has driven the expansion of telemedicine solutions worldwide, enabling remote diagnosis, patient monitoring, and treatment support. This study aimed to explore medical students' perceptions of AI in telemedicine, focusing on how these future physicians view AI's potential, benefits, and challenges. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 161 Romanian medical students spanning Years 1 through 6. Participants completed a 15-item questionnaire covering demographic factors, prior exposure to AI, attitudes toward telemedicine, perceived benefits, and concerns related to ethical and data privacy issues. A questionnaire on digital health acceptance was conceived and integrated into the survey instrument. Results: Out of 161 respondents, 70 (43.5%) reported prior telemedicine use, and 66 (41.0%) indicated high familiarity (Likert scores >= 4) with AI-based tools. Fifth- and sixth-year students showed significantly greater acceptance of AI-driven telemedicine compared to first- and second-year students (p = 0.014). A moderate positive correlation (r = 0.44, p < 0.001) emerged between AI familiarity and telemedicine confidence, while higher data privacy concerns negatively affected acceptance (beta = -0.20, p = 0.038). Gender differences were noted but did not reach consistent statistical significance in multivariate models. Conclusions: Overall, Romanian medical students view AI-enhanced telemedicine favorably, particularly those in advanced academic years. Familiarity with AI technologies is a key driver of acceptance, though privacy and ethical considerations remain barriers. These findings underline the need for targeted curricular interventions to bolster AI literacy and address concerns regarding data security and clinical responsibility. By proactively integrating AI-related competencies, medical faculties can better prepare students for a healthcare landscape increasingly shaped by telemedicine.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.82,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13345,"Classroom innovation atmosphere and student creativity: the roles of AI technology application, intrinsic motivation, and self-efficacy","Creativity is a key capability that drives innovation and solves complex problems, serving as an important pathway to realizing personal potential. Based on social cognitive theory, this study constructs a theoretical model with classroom innovation atmosphere as the independent variable, student creativity as the dependent variable, AI technology application and intrinsic motivation as mediating variables, and self-efficacy as the moderating variable. A survey was conducted among 270 college students from the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Shanghai region, and Hayes's PROCESS macro (Model 7) was employed to perform Bootstrap sampling (sample size = 5,000) for testing. The results show that: classroom innovation atmosphere has a significant positive impact on student creativity (beta = 0.182, p < 0.01); AI technology application (indirect effect = 0.0267, 95% CI [0.0034, 0.0598]) and intrinsic motivation (indirect effect = 0.1029, 95% CI [0.0281, 0.1820]) play significant mediating roles between classroom innovation atmosphere and creativity; self-efficacy not only positively moderates the relationship between classroom innovation atmosphere and AI technology application (beta = 0.339, p < 0.05) as well as intrinsic motivation (beta = 0.083, p < 0.05), but also moderates the indirect effects mediated by AI technology application and intrinsic motivation (moderated mediation indices were 0.0373, 95% CI [0.0023, 0.1195] and 0.6574, 95% CI [0.2512, 0.8066], respectively).

Based on these variables, we identify three meaningful student groups, which can guide educational initiatives. We recruited 1465 undergraduate and graduate students from the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany and measured their AI self-efficacy, AI literacy, interest in AI, attitudes towards AI, and AI use. Using a path model, we examine the correlations and paths among these variables. Results reveal that AI usage and positive AI attitudes significantly predict interest in AI, which in turn and together with AI literacy, enhance AI self-efficacy. Moreover, using Gaussian Mixture Models, we identify three groups of students: 'AI Advocates,' 'Cautious Critics,' and 'Pragmatic Observers,' each exhibiting unique patterns of AI-related cognitive, affective, and behavioral traits. Our findings demonstrate the necessity of educational strategies that not only focus on AI literacy but also aim to foster students' AI attitudes, usage, and interest to effectively promote AI self-efficacy. Furthermore, we argue that educators who aim to design inclusive AI educational programs should take into account the distinct needs of different student groups identified in this study.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.74,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The moderating role of gender is also examined in this research. Design/methodology/approach: The data of this study was collected through a questionnaire filled by 330 accounting and auditing students enrolled in the Lebanese private universities during the academic year 2021–2022. The hierarchical multiple regression analysis was conducted to test the study’s hypotheses. Findings: The results show that TR and PU affect positively the adoption of AI; however, PEOU has an insignificant impact on the students’ decision to adopt AI. The outcomes also reveal that males tend more to adopt AI than females and gender moderates the associations between TR, PU, PEOU and adoption of AI. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest that accounting educators should adjust the curricula of the accounting programs and prepare students to be well equipped with technological skills through training them on AI software. Originality/value: According to the researcher’s knowledge, this study is the first that examines the moderating effect of gender on the associations between TR, use perceptions and AI adoption by accounting and auditing students. Besides, this research is the first that investigates the antecedents of AI adoption by students in Lebanese private universities.

REC_13796,"Nursing Students' Perceptions of AI-Driven Mental Health Support and Its Relationship with Anxiety, Depression, and Seeking Professional Psychological Help: Transitioning from Traditional Counseling to Digital Support","Background: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into mental health care is reshaping psychological support systems, particularly for digitally literate populations such as nursing students. Given the high prevalence of anxiety and depression in this group, understanding their perceptions of AI-driven mental health support is critical for effective implementation. Objectives: to evaluate nursing students' perceptions toward AI-driven mental health support and examine its relationship with anxiety, depression, and their attitudes to seeking professional psychological help. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 176 undergraduate nursing students in northern Jordan. Results: Students reported moderately positive perceptions toward AI-driven mental health support (mean score: 36.70 +/- 4.80). Multiple linear regression revealed that prior use of AI tools (beta = 0.44, p < 0.0001), positive help-seeking attitudes (beta = 0.41, p < 0.0001), and higher levels of psychological distress encompassing both anxiety (beta = 0.29, p = 0.005) and depression (beta = 0.24, p = 0.007) significantly predicted more positive perceptions. Daily AI usage was not a significant predictor (beta = 0.15, p = 0.174). Logistic regression analysis further indicated that psychological distress, reflected by elevated anxiety (OR = 1.42, p = 0.002) and depression scores (OR = 1.32, p = 0.003), along with stronger help-seeking attitudes (OR = 1.35, p = 0.011), significantly increased the likelihood of using AI-based mental health support. Conclusions: AI-driven mental health tools hold promises as adjuncts to traditional counseling, particularly for nursing students experiencing psychological distress.

REC_01519,"“Don’t get distracted!”: The role of social robots’ interaction style on users’ cognitive performance, acceptance, and non-compliant behavior","Social robots are developed to provide companionship and assistance in the daily life of the children, older, and disable people but also have great potential as educational technology by facilitating learning. In these application areas, a social robot can take the role of a coach by training and assisting individuals also in cognitive tasks. Since a robot’s interaction style affects users’ trust and acceptance, customizing its behavior to the proposed tasks could, potentially, have an impact on the users’ performance. To investigate these phenomena, we enrolled sixty volunteers and endowed a social robot with a friendly and an authoritarian interaction style. The aim was to explore whether and how the robot’s interaction style could enhance users’ cognitive performance during a psychometric evaluation. The results showed that the authoritarian interaction style seems to be more appropriate to improve the performance when the tasks require high cognitive demands. These differences in cognitive performance between the groups did not depend on users’ intrinsic characteristics, such as gender and personality traits. Nevertheless, in the authoritarian condition, participants’ cognitive performance was related to their trust and the acceptance of the technology. Finally, we found that users’ non-compliant behavior was not related to their personality traits. This finding indirectly supports the role of the robot’s interaction style in influencing the compliance behavior of the users.

The order of authors in the author list of the published paper was erroneously given as: Xinyi Cai and Wenhua Wen. The correct author list reads: Wenhua Wen and Xinyi Cai. The original version of this article has been updated. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record 2026-96494-001). Introduction With the widespread adoption of AI by Chinese university teachers in their work processes, an increasing number of complexes work this study aims to examine are being handled by AI. Under these circumstances, as traditional knowledge workers, Chinese university teachers may develop concerns about their career prospects, leading to negative work attitudes and pessimism, which could ultimately affect their work performance. Methods Based on the knowledge worker’s perspective of relationship between leader and subordinates and through a self-administered survey, valid questionnaires were collected from 423 Chinese university teachers working in 64 Chinese universities, and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed for data analysis. Results In the result, the study reveals a negative correlation between Chinese university teachers’ AI awareness and LMX, as well as a positive association between servant leadership and LMX. Furthermore, it demonstrates that Chinese university teachers’ LMX is negatively related to turnover intention, which in turn shows a negative relationship with work performance. Discussion Against the background of widespread AI adoption in China, this research provides both theoretical implications and practical suggestions for managing, motivating, and inspiring Chinese university teachers to enhance their work performance and thereby improve organizational performance.

REC_02192,A cross-national assessment of artificial intelligence (AI) Chatbot user perceptions in collegiate physics education,"This study explores the perception of artificial intelligence (AI)-based Chatbots, specifically Open AI's ChatGPT use, among physics students in four universities in Ghana, Jordan, and the United States. We utilized a survey instrument adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to elicit responses from 804 students. TAM constructs: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEU), Subjective Norms (SN), Attitude Towards Technology Use (ATU), Behavioral Intention (BI), and User Behavior (UB) were assessed. We also assessed perceptions of ethical use (EU) and student learning outcomes (SLO) using a Structural Equation Model (SEM) approach. A measurement model had good fit indices and validated most hypotheses. A path analysis (PA) for hypothesized relationships suggested PEU and SN are significant predictors of BI and UB, whereas PU's influence on BI was indirect. Significantly, EU concerns negatively moderated the relationship between BI and UB, suggesting that higher ethical concerns can reduce ChatGPT usage. Cross-cultural analysis uncovered significant differences in perceptions and usage patterns influenced by institutional policies, academic levels, and demographic factors. Our findings affirm TAM's robustness in predicting technology use across various cultural and institutional settings. Findings also underscore the crucial roles of social influence in fostering positive user behaviors for Chat GPT. This study provides insights for educators and policymakers to develop strategies for integrating AI Chatbots responsibly and effectively in collegiate physics education while addressing ethical concerns.

REC_06606,Construction professionals' perspectives of adaptive learning adoption: an SEM-machine learning approach,"PurposeThis study aims to examine the acceptance of adaptive learning (AL) amongst construction professionals in Singapore. It seeks to compare their perceptions and attitudes with those of professionals from other industries to assess the rate of AL adoption in the construction sector. Furthermore, the study aims to identify the factors influencing construction professionals' intention to adopt AL technologies.Design/methodology/approachA questionnaire survey was conducted with 188 construction professionals and 153 non-construction professionals. By employing the extended unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) and the general extended technology acceptance model for e-learning (GETAMEL), this study also explored factors influencing construction professionals' behavioural intention (BI) towards AL adoption. An SEM-machine learning approach facilitated the evaluation of the factors' influence on BI.FindingsA comparative analysis of the data found that construction professionals' intention to use AL surpassed 75%, which had no significant difference with professionals from other industries. The findings revealed that learning value (LV) and self-efficacy (SE) were statistically significant predictors of construction professionals' intentions to use AL. Furthermore, a supervised machine learning analysis identified performance expectancy (PE) as a crucial factor in predicting these intentions.Research limitations/implicationsThe study's focus on self-reported intentions and a specific demographic limits its generalisability; further research should examine actual usage across diverse cultures.Practical implicationsThe results offered insights into construction professionals' perceptions and attitudes towards AL adoption, guiding the integration of AL into construction professional development.Originality/valueThis paper addresses a recognised gap by examining construction professionals' perceptions and attitudes towards adopting AL.Table A1Descriptive statistics (i.e. means (M), standard deviations (SD), relative frequencies)QuestionGroupMSDStrongly disagreeDisagreeNeutralAgreeStrongly agree% agreementInferential test usedp-valueMDEXP1.

Methods: The sample consisted of 358 students from the University of Alicante, aged between 16 and 30 years; 88 participants identified as having a disability, while 270 reported no disability. The gender distribution was balanced, with 53% women and 47% men. An ad hoc questionnaire was applied to evaluate familiarity, frequency of use, and perceived usefulness of AI as a means of obtaining informational and emotional support. Results: The results of the multivariate analyses indicated that students without disabilities reported greater familiarity with and more frequent use of AI tools compared to students with disabilities. Significant differences were found in perceived usefulness for obtaining both informational and emotional support, with higher ratings among students without disabilities, and a moderate effect size. Moreover, frequency of use was positively associated with perceived usefulness in both groups, suggesting that practical experience influences users' evaluations. Discussions: The findings suggest that students perceive AI as a useful resource for informational and emotional support.

REC_02196,U.S. college students' acceptability and educational benefits of ChatGPT from a digital divide perspective,"ChatGPT has diffused widely and rapidly, with diverse positive and negative implications. In educational settings it is important to understand students' perceptions of the acceptability of ChatGPT for various learning activities and to examine whether prior digital divide concerns pertain to this digital innovation, in order to provide guidance for users, inform policymakers and other stakeholders, and extend digital divide research. The purpose is to investigate the associations of socioeconomic status (SES, both family and student), gender, and race/ ethnicity with students' perceived acceptability of common ChatGPT activities as well as their opinion about how beneficial ChatGPT is for college education, and additionally, whether such relationships differ based on adoption experience. We analyzed survey data quantitatively in two phases (N = 360 and 1267), applying measurement reliability and validity, correlations, and structural equation modeling. The results indicate that students with higher family SES and lower individual SES, and females, tend to view the acceptability of ChatGPT uses more positively, although racial/ethnic minorities are more critical of displacement activities. ChatGPT adopters perceive two dimensions of ChatGPT activities (academic support and academic displacement) as more acceptable than do non-adopters, and they also perceive uses for academic support more positively than for displacement. Moreover, adoption is a significant moderator of some of these associations. At this early stage of ChatGPT diffusion, these digital divide influences on acceptability and general opinion are weak and variable.

REC_13848,Understanding Medical Students' Perceptions of and Behavioral Intentions toward Learning Artificial Intelligence: A Survey Study,"Medical students learning to use artificial intelligence for medical practices is likely to enhance medical services. However, studies in this area have been lacking. The present study investigated medical students' perceptions of and behavioral intentions toward learning artificial intelligence (AI) in clinical practice based on the theory of planned behavior (TPB). A sum of 274 Year-5 undergraduates and master's and doctoral postgraduates participated in the online survey. Six constructs were measured, including (1) personal relevance (PR) of medical AI, (2) subjective norm (SN) related to learning medical AI, (3) perceived self-efficacy (PSE) of learning medical AI, (4) basic knowledge (BKn) of medical AI, (5) behavioral intention (BI) toward learning medical AI and (6) actual learning (AL) of medical AI. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modelling were employed to analyze the data. The results showed that the proposed model had a good model fit and the theoretical hypotheses in relation to the TPB were mostly confirmed. Specifically, (a) BI had a significantly strong and positive impact on AL; (b) BI was significantly predicted by PR, SN and PSE, whilst BKn did not have a direct effect on BI; (c) PR was significantly and positively predicted by SN and PSE, but BKn failed to predict PR; (d) both SN and BKn had significant and positive impact on PSE, and BKn had a significantly positive effect on SN.

REC_02197,What influences college students using AI for academic writing? - A quantitative analysis based on HISAM and TRI theory,"Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been widely adopted as tools for academic writing, sparking interest in the factors that influence their adoption. However, existing research has predominantly focused on cognitive factors, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, while giving insufficient attention to emotional motivations (e.g., perceived enjoyment, emotional engagement) in students' use of AI tools. This gap has led to a somewhat oversimplified or incomplete understanding of the factors influencing students' adoption of AI technologies. This study constructs a theoretical framework based on the Hedonic Information System Acceptance Model (HISAM) and the Technology Readiness Index (TRI), and employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze survey data from 148 university students. The study finds that students' intention to use AI tools is influenced not only by cognitive evaluations, such as perceived usefulness and ease of use, but also by emotional factors, including technological optimism and perceived enjoyment. Perceived enjoyment, as a positive emotional factor in the interaction process, significantly promotes students' usage intention. Additionally, technological optimism, as a positive aspect of technology readiness, has a direct positive effect on perceived enjoyment. Furthermore, although negative experiences such as technical discomfort and insecurity have a minor impact on the evaluation of AI tool functionality, they still affect students' emotional experiences, thereby influencing their usage intention. The study suggests that future AI tool designs should prioritize enhancing students' emotional experiences by providing personalized feedback and optimizing user interfaces to improve ease of use. Moreover, increasing the tool's interpretability and transparency can help reduce the risks of misuse, such as academic dishonesty or a decline in learning ability, which may arise from negative emotional experiences.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.85,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_06657,Application of artificial intelligence technologies in library services at the top 100 US universities,"Purpose - Through a systematic content analysis, this paper aims to examine the current use of artificial intelligence (AI) in the services of the top 100 US university libraries and explores the key factors that influence the adoption of this technology. It seeks to provide actionable strategic recommendations for library administrators. These recommendations aim to help libraries accelerate their intelligent service transformation while maintaining their academic resource advantages and humanistic traditions, and to establish a solid theoretical and empirical foundation for future research. Design/methodology/approach - The authors analyse the current status of libraries adopting AI technologies and applying them to patron services, which include intelligent retrieval services, intelligent reference services, intelligent guided tour services and intelligent ID recognition services, among others. Firstly, the authors visit the official websites of the top 100 US university libraries to collect information. Subsequently, the prevalence of AI technologies is statistically analysed, and several excellent practice cases are selected. Finally, based on the data obtained from the content analysis, the impact of university rankings on the adoption of AI technologies in US university libraries is analysed. Findings - The study finds that AI technologies are widely applied in the services of US university libraries, but there are differences in the adoption rates across different services. Almost all libraries have adopted intelligent retrieval and recommendation technology (99%). In terms of intelligent reference services, more than half of the libraries have used AI technologies (53%). Intelligent guided tour technology is also widely adopted (95%). The application of intelligent ID recognition technology in libraries is equally common (98%). Furthermore, more than half of the libraries have begun to explore generative AI technologies (61%). Additionally, the study further discovers that there is a significant negative correlation between university rankings and the number of AI technologies adopted by libraries. This indicates that top-ranked universities are more likely to introduce a variety of AI technologies in their library services. Research limitations/implications - The study's implications include constructing an analytical framework to assess AI in library services and identifying key adoption factors. It explores AI's impact on service diversity and the popularity of different services. Notably, it finds a link between university rankings and AI adoption, offering insights into the relationship between tech adoption and institutional reputation.

REC_13881,Determinants of Humanities and Social Sciences Students' Intentions to Use Artificial Intelligence Applications for Academic Purposes,"Recent research emphasizes the importance of Artificial Intelligence applications as supporting tools for students in higher education. Simultaneously, an intensive exchange of views has started in the public debate in the international educational community. However, for a more proper use of these applications, it is necessary to investigate the factors that explain their intention and actual use in the future. With the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model, this work analyses the factors influencing students' use and intention to use Artificial Intelligence technology. For this purpose, a sample of 197 Greek students at the School of Humanities and Social Sciences from the University of Patras participated in a survey. The findings highlight that expected performance, habit, and enjoyment of these Artificial Intelligence applications are key determinants influencing teachers' intentions to use them. Moreover, behavioural intention, habit, and facilitating conditions explain the usage of these Artificial Intelligence applications. This study did not reveal any moderating effects. The limitations, practical implications, and proposed directions for future research based on these results are discussed.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.67,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00718,Understanding key drivers affecting students' use of artificial intelligence-based voice assistants,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based voice assistants have become an essential part of our daily lives. Yet, little is known concerning what motivates students to use them in educational activities. Therefore, this research develops a theoretical model by extending the technology acceptance model (TAM) with subjective norm, enjoyment, facilitating conditions, trust, and security to examine students' use of AI-based voice assistants for instructional purposes. The developed model was then validated based on data collected from 300 university students using the PLS-SEM technique. The results supported the role of enjoyment, trust, and perceived ease of use (PEOU) in affecting the perceived usefulness (PU) of voice assistants. The empirical results also showed that facilitating conditions and trust in technology strongly influence the PEOU. Contrary to the extant literature, the results indicated that subjective norm, facilitating conditions, and security did not impact PU. Similarly, subjective norm and enjoyment did not affect PEOU. This research is believed to add a holistic understanding of the key drivers affecting students' use of voice assistants for educational purposes. It offers several theoretical contributions and practical implications on how to successfully employ these assistants.",2022,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.74,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00720,"Adoption, use and enhancement of virtual learning during COVID-19","This study focuses on the uses of digital technology during teaching and learning. The preparedness, adoption, and use of virtual learning are inquired. Technology cannot enhance learning unless adopted, embraced, and effectively used. Three hundred and one (301) online questionnaires were administered to Higher and Tertiary institutions (HTEIs) students. The data were analyzed using the Structural Equation Model (SEM). Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), and Social Influence (SI) were confirmed to be positive predictors of the Behavioural Intention (BI) to use technology. Facilitating Conditions (FC) is a non-significant construct to BI to use technology. Thus, irrespective of the availability of Information Communication Technologies (ICT) infrastructure and support needed to use virtual learning, students are forced to use virtual technology due to COVID-19. Pandemics such as COVID-19 force students and lecturers to use virtual learning irrespective of factors surrounding them. Pandemics are an anchor for the full embracement of virtual learning. Pandemic 'like' elements applied in the education system foster education. Google Classroom and its features prove to improve the teaching and learning processes. Chatbots and contextualized virtual Educational Humanoid robots enhance learning through interactivity.

This study addresses this gap by integrating the theory of planned behavior, technology acceptance model, theories of motivation, and computer self-efficacy to explore the factors affecting learners' behavioral intentions in AI education. Using the AI course quality as the primary antecedent and intention to continue taking courses as the dependent variable, the study investigates the structural relationships and mediating variables between these factors. Data were collected through a stratified random sampling method from 19 universities in Taiwan, involving 200 students who had completed five core AI-related courses, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, internet of things, big data, and robotics. The analysis, conducted using PLS-SEM, revealed that AI course quality directly and indirectly influences learners' behavioral intentions through mediating variables such as learning satisfaction, computer self-efficacy, technological literacy, and computer learning motivation. Moreover, AI course quality exerted a significant positive effect on computer motivation, which, in turn, influenced self-efficacy and learning outcomes.

REC_02204,Understanding of ChatGPT adoption among business school students,"OpenAI's latest version of Generative Pre-Trained Transformer, GPT-3, has caused a lot of debates and controversies worldwide concerning its deployment and possible uses. Therefore, the current research objective is to develop a proposed model based on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) with other much-related factors to examine the role of ChatGPT adoption services in enhancing student communication and collaboration skills in developing countries (e.g., Jordan). This study also investigates the mediating role of performance expectancy and the moderating role of innovativeness toward these services. The online questionnaire was used as an instrument to collect data from 622 business school students in Jordanian higher education institutions and the scale of measurement was on a five-point Likert scale. Collected data were analyzed through Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The findings mainly confirm that all direct hypotheses (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating condition, hedonic motivation, and trust on the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT services which in turn affects ChatGPT adoption) are accepted except hypothesis (H7) which states that there is a positive relationship between habit and the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT services and thus the related hypothesis was rejected. Concerning indirect hypotheses, the results also confirmed the mediating role of performance expectancy and the moderating role of innovativeness toward these services, and thus the indirect hypotheses (H2 and H10) were accepted. Thus, the current research is vital because it raises concerns and future worries of students in tertiary institutions on how they will manage AI language models like ChatGPT that are going to be unavoidable parts of our lives.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.82,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

This study investigates the determinants of ChatGPT adoption intentions (CGPTAIs) by extending the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to include the mediating roles of perceived trust (PT) and perceived risk (PR). Using a quantitative cross-sectional design, the data from 435 participants were analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) to explore the relationships among the perceived ease of use (PE), perceived intelligence (PI), perceived usefulness (PUSE), PT, and PR. Tau he findings reveal that the perceived ease of use (PE) and perceived intelligence (PI) significantly drive adoption intentions, while perceived usefulness (PUSE) plays a limited role. PR fully mediates the relationship between PUSE and CGPTAI and partially mediates PE and PI, while PT fully mediates PUSE and partially mediates PE, but not PI. Multi-group analysis highlights demographic differences, such as age and prior AI experience, in adoption pathways. These results challenge traditional TAM assumptions, advancing the model to account for the interplay of usability, intelligence, trust, and risk.

REC_02205,Factors affecting acceptance of ChatGPT-4o by English language instructors: The extended TAM approach,"Artificial intelligence-based educational technologies, especially ChatGPT-4o, have the potential to revolutionize education, and the adoption of these technologies is closely related to perceptual and emotional status of the users. The present study investigated the factors affecting the adoption of ChatGPT-4o by English language instructors in Turkey using Extended Technology Acceptance Model. Stratified sampling was used to select 30 universities in the “Social Sciences and Humanities-Language and Literature” category, with quality scores between 20 and 60. A total of 480 English Language Instructors employed at the Schools of Foreign Languages at these universities participated in the study. The study analyzed the effects of variables such as social influence, perceived trust, perceived enjoyment, artificial intellegence anxiety and artificial intellegence self-efficacy on perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention to use. The analyses were conducted using the PLS-SEM method and revealed that perceived trust and social influence played a key role in the acceptance of the benefits of the technology, while perceived enjoyment improved perceived ease of use. The negative effect of artificial intellegence anxiety on perceived ease of use reflected English language instructors’ reluctance to adopt ChatGPT-4o. The results showed that social, perceptual, and emotional factors were critical to the acceptance in the adoption of ChatGPT-4o. The results of the current study suggest that strategies should be developed to improve English language instructors’ perceptions of artificial intellegence technologies in order to ensure the active use of artificial intellegence-based technologies and ChatGPT-4o in education. © 2025 The Authors",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13887,"Trust in Generative AI Tools: A Comparative Study of Higher Education Students, Teachers, and Researchers","Generative AI (GenAI) tools, including ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, and Google Gemini, are rapidly reshaping higher education by transforming how students, educators, and researchers engage with learning, teaching, and academic work. Despite their growing presence, the adoption of GenAI remains inconsistent, largely due to the absence of universal guidelines and trust-related concerns. This study examines how trust, defined across three key dimensions (accuracy and relevance, privacy protection, and nonmaliciousness), influences the adoption and use of GenAI tools in academic environments. Using survey data from 823 participants across different academic roles, this study employs multiple regression analysis to explore the relationship between trust, user characteristics, and behavioral intention. The results reveal that trust is primarily experience-driven. Frequency of use, duration of use, and self-assessed proficiency significantly predict trust, whereas demographic factors, such as gender and academic role, have no significant influence. Furthermore, trust emerges as a strong predictor of behavioral intention to adopt GenAI tools. These findings reinforce trust calibration theory and extend the UTAUT2 framework to the context of GenAI in education. This study highlights that fostering appropriate trust through transparent policies, privacy safeguards, and practical training is critical for enabling responsible, ethical, and effective integration of GenAI into higher education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.92,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01717,Scaling Academic Writing Instruction: Evaluation of a Scaffolding Tool (Thesis Writer),"No thesis - no graduation. Academic writing poses manifold challenges to students, instructors and institutions alike. High labor costs, increasing student numbers, and the Bologna Process (which has reduced the period after which undergraduates in Europe submit their first thesis and thus the time available to focus on writing skills) all pose a threat to students' academic writing abilities. This situation gave rise to the practical goal of this study: to determine if, and to what extent, academic writing and its instruction can be scaled (i.e., designed more efficiently) using a technological solution, in this case Thesis Writer (TW), a domain-specific, online learning environment for the scaffolding of student academic writing, combined with an online editor optimized for producing academic text. Compared to existing automated essay scoring and writing evaluation tools, TW is not focusing on feedback but on instruction, planning, and genre mastery. While most US-based tools, particularly those also used in secondary education, are targeting on the essay genre, TW is tailored to the needs of theses and research article writing (IMRD scheme).

Survey data from 635 Chinese university students were analyzed using an integrated methodological approach combining Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA), and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) methodologies. Results consistently identified PEN as the most influential factor, followed by PT, while PI and PE were significant but exhibited weaker predictive power. EE and SI showed no significant influence. IPMA further revealed that students' trust in AI security remains relatively low, indicating substantial room for improvement. The methodological triangulation demonstrated the complementary strengths of different analytical techniques, with PLS-SEM providing structural relationships, IPMA revealing performance gaps, and ANN capturing nonlinear relationships while validating importance rankings. The study contributes to educational technology literature by demonstrating how PLS-SEM, IPMA, and ANN can be effectively integrated to provide comprehensive insights into behavioral intention models, extending the UTAUT framework with underexamined variables in the context of AI chatbot adoption. Future research could explore the integration of additional analytical techniques within this methodological framework and investigate contextual factors that shape technology adoption patterns.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.71,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13890,Exploring the Determinants of Continuous Participation in Virtual International Design Workshops Mediated by AI-Driven Digital Humans,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies and Virtual Exchange (VE) become increasingly embedded in higher education, AI-driven digital humans have begun to feature in design-oriented virtual international workshops, providing a novel context for examining learner behaviour. This study develops a structural model to examine the links between system support, interaction processes, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and international learning intention. Specifically, it investigates how perceived AI support, system ease of use, and interaction intensity influence students' continuous participation in international learning through the mediating roles of learning self-efficacy, interaction quality, and satisfaction. Data were collected through an online questionnaire administered to undergraduate and postgraduate students who had participated in an AI-driven digital human-supported online international design workshop, yielding 611 valid responses. Reliability and validity analyses, as well as structural equation modelling, were conducted using SPSS 22 and AMOS v.22.0. The results show that perceived AI support, system ease of use, and interaction intensity each have a significant positive effect on learning self-efficacy and interaction quality. Both self-efficacy and interaction quality, in turn, significantly enhance learning satisfaction, which subsequently increases students' intentions for sustained participation in international learning. Overall, the findings reveal a coherent causal chain: AI-driven digital human system characteristics -> learning process experience -> learning satisfaction -> sustained participation intention. This study demonstrates that integrating AI-driven digital humans can meaningfully improve learners' process experiences in virtual international design workshops. The results provide empirical guidance for curriculum design, pedagogical strategies, and platform optimization in AI-supported, design-oriented virtual international learning environments.",2025,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.78,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01720,What explains teachers’ trust in AI in education across six countries?,"With growing expectations to use AI-based educational technology (AI-EdTech) to improve students’ learning outcomes and enrich teaching practice, teachers play a central role in the adoption of AI-EdTech in classrooms. Teachers’ willingness to accept vulnerability by integrating technology into their everyday teaching practice, that is, their trust in AI-EdTech, will depend on how much they expect it to benefit them versus how many concerns it raises for them. In this study, we surveyed 508 K-12 teachers across six countries on four continents to understand which teacher characteristics shape teachers’ trust in AI-EdTech, and its proposed antecedents, perceived benefits and concerns about AI-EdTech. We examined a comprehensive set of characteristics including demographic and professional characteristics (age, gender, subject, years of experience, etc.), cultural values (Hofstede’s cultural dimensions), geographic locations (Brazil, Israel, Japan, Norway, Sweden, USA), and psychological factors (self-efficacy and understanding). Using multiple regression analysis, we found that teachers with higher AI-EdTech self-efficacy and AI understanding perceive more benefits, fewer concerns, and report more trust in AI-EdTech. We also found geographic and cultural differences in teachers’ trust in AI-EdTech, but no demographic differences emerged based on their age, gender, or level of education. The findings provide a comprehensive, international account of factors associated with teachers’ trust in AI-EdTech. Efforts to raise teachers’ understanding of, and trust in AI-EdTech, while considering their cultural values are encouraged to support its adoption in K-12 education.

REC_13484,A longitudinal study on artificial intelligence adoption: understanding the drivers of ChatGPT usage behavior change in higher education,"As the field of artificial intelligence (AI) continues to progress, the use of AI-powered chatbots, such as ChatGPT, in higher education settings has gained significant attention. This paper addresses a well-defined problem pertaining to the critical need for a comprehensive examination of students' ChatGPT adoption in higher education. To examine such adoption, it is imperative to focus on measuring actual user behavior. While measuring students' ChatGPT usage behavior at a specific point in time can be valuable, a more holistic approach is necessary to understand the temporal dynamics of AI adoption. To address this need, a longitudinal survey was conducted, examining how students' ChatGPT usage behavior changes over time among students, and unveiling the drivers of such behavior change. The empirical examination of 222 Dutch higher education students revealed a significant decline in students' ChatGPT usage behavior over an 8 month period. This period was defined by two distinct data collection phases: the initial phase (T1) and a follow-up phase conducted 8 months later (T2). Furthermore, the results demonstrate that changes in trust, emotional creepiness, and Perceived Behavioral Control significantly predicted the observed change in usage behavior. The findings of this research carry significant academic and managerial implications, as they advance our comprehension of the temporal aspects of AI adoption in higher education.

REC_13891,Chatbot Technology Use and Acceptance Using Educational Personas,"Chatbots are computer programs that mimic human conversation using text or voice or both. Users' acceptance of chatbots is highly influenced by their persona. Users develop a sense of familiarity with chatbots as they use them, so they become more approachable, and this encourages them to interact with the chatbots more readily by fostering favorable opinions of the technology. In this study, we examine the moderating effects of persona traits on students' acceptance and use of chatbot technology at higher educational institutions in the UK. We use an Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (Extended UTAUT2). Through a self-administrated survey using a questionnaire, data were collected from 431 undergraduate and postgraduate computer science students. This study employed a Likert scale to measure the variables associated with chatbot acceptance. To evaluate the gathered data, Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) coupled with multi-group analysis (MGA) using SmartPLS3 were used. The estimated Cronbach's alpha highlighted the accuracy and legitimacy of the findings. The results showed that the emerging factors that influence students' adoption and use of chatbot technology were habit, effort expectancy, and performance expectancy. Additionally, it was discovered that the Extended UTAUT2 model did not require grades or educational level to moderate the correlations.

Two studies were conducted, encompassing both younger (Study 1: N = 385, 46% girls, mean age 14 years) and older (Study 2: N = 359, 67% girls, mean age 17 years) adolescents, to comprehensively examine these associations across different age groups. In Study 1, approximately 14.8% of participants reported using generative AI, while in Study 2, the adoption rate among older students was 52.6%, with ChatGPT emerging as the preferred tool among adolescents in both studies. Consistently across both studies, we found that adolescents facing more EF challenges perceived generative AI as more useful for schoolwork, particularly in completing assignments. Notably, academic achievement showed no significant associations with AI usage or usefulness, as revealed in Study 1. This study represents the first exploration into how individual characteristics, such as EF, relate to the frequency and perceived usefulness of LLM generative AI chatbots for schoolwork among adolescents. Given the early stage of generative AI chatbots during the survey, future research should validate these findings and delve deeper into the utilization and integration of generative AI into educational settings.

REC_02215,Measures of learner-generative ai relationships,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into educational environments, understanding the relationship between learners and AI systems is crucial for optimizing learning outcomes. This study introduces and validates the Learner-Generative AI Relationship Scale, a novel instrument designed to measure the multifaceted nature of learner-AI relationship in educational settings. The scale was developed through a rigorous process involving literature review, expert reviews, and cognitive pre-testing. An exploratory factor analysis with 95 undergraduate students confirmed a three-factor structure: Affective Intimacy, Cognitive Competence, and Social Flow, each comprising three sub-factors. The scale demonstrated good internal consistency and construct validity. To establish concurrent and predictive validity, 75 participants completed an argumentative essay writing task using ChatGPT. Concurrent validity was established through significant correlations with measures of attitude toward AI and AI self-efficacy. Predictive validity was confirmed through regression analyses, which showed that the learner-generative AI relationship significantly predicted learning engagement, perceived cognitive effects, and perceived motivational effects in a ChatGPT-assisted argumentative writing task. This study addresses a critical gap in the literature by providing a comprehensive tool for measuring learner-AI relationships beyond mere interactions and attitudes. The learner-generative AI relationship scale offers researchers and educators a valuable instrument for understanding and improving AI-driven educational systems, potentially informing the design of more effective AI-enhanced learning experiences.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.68,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

However, the underlying mechanisms driving GenAI reliance and its consequences remain underexplored. This study aimed to address these gaps by investigating the relationships among academic self-efficacy, academic anxiety, performance expectations, and GenAI reliance, as well as examining the consequences of GenAI reliance and coping strategies to mitigate these issues. Data were collected from 337 university students in a Chinese university and analyzed using Pearson correlation, chain mediation effect, and thematic analysis. The results indicated no significant direct relationship between academic self-efficacy and GenAI reliance. However, academic anxiety and performance expectations were found to mediate this relationship. The most salient consequences of GenAI reliance were decreased independent thinking ability, reduced innovative thinking ability, restricted self-reflection, and limited critical thinking ability. Additionally, students' self-initiated and expected teacher-initiated strategies to alleviate these consequences were recognized.

REC_00750,Factors influencing students' intention to adopt and use ChatGPT in higher education: A study in the Vietnamese context,"ChatGPT, an extensively recognised language model created by OpenAI, has gained significant prominence across various industries, particularly in education. This study aimed to investigate the factors that influence students' intentions to adopt and utilise ChatGPT for their academic studies. The study used a Structural Equation Model (SEM) for analysing the data gathered from 108 participants, comprising both undergraduate and postgraduate students enrolled in public and private universities in Vietnam. The findings indicated that students' inclination to adopt ChatGPT (referred to as adoption intention or AI) was influenced by their perception of its user-friendliness (PEU). However, the perceived usefulness (PU) of ChatGPT did not have a direct impact on students' adoption intention; instead, it had an indirect influence through personalisation (with a positive effect) and interactivity (with a negative effect). Importantly, there was no significant indirect effect of PU on AI mediated by perceived trust and perceived intelligence. This study is one of the initial empirical inquiries into ChatGPT adoption within an Asian context, providing valuable insights in this emerging area of research. As the use of ChatGPT by students becomes increasingly inevitable, educational institutions should carefully consider integrating it into the assessment process. It is crucial to design assessments that encourage responsible usage of ChatGPT, preserving students' critical thinking abilities and creativity in their assessment writing.

REC_00758,Gen-AI integration in higher education: Predicting intentions using SEM-ANN approach,"This research delves into the multifaceted landscape of various factors that influence the adoption of Generation-Artificial Intelligence (Gen-AI) in Higher Education. By employing a comprehensive framework that includes perceived risk, perceived ease of use, usefulness, Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), and trust, the study aims to reveal the crucial roles that these factors play in shaping the intention to embrace Gen-AI. Through the utilization of a hybrid approach that combines Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), the research examines the complex relationships among these predictors and their overall impact on the adoption of Gen-AI. By examining a diverse cohort of 242 participants, including undergraduate and postgraduate students, as well as faculty members from Indian Higher Education Institutions, the research uncovers significant determinants such as perceived ease of use, usefulness, TPACK, and trust. Interestingly, perceived usefulness does not emerge as a significant factor in influencing the intention to adopt AI in Higher Education. Through demographic analysis using the SPSS statistical tool package, the study reveals non-compensatory and nonlinear relationships between age, gender, and the intention to use AI. By leveraging the significant predictors identified through SEM, the developed ANN model accurately predicts the intention to use AI with a 71% accuracy rate.

REC_00763,Students' attitudes towards an AI-based interview for university admissions: Scale development and intervention effects,"This research endeavors to introduce a comprehensive scale tailored to gauge high school students' attitudes toward AI-based interviews for university admissions. Moreover, the study delves into the impact of information provisioning on students' attitudes toward AI-based interviews. The participant cohort comprised 604 high school students, who were on average 17.93 years old(S.D. = 0.80). The structured questionnaire, containing the newly formulated items, was distributed via Google Forms. In Study 1, two distinct scales were devised: the Positive Aspects of AI-based Interview Scale(PAAIS), encompassing 14 items to gauge affirmative perceptions, and the Negative Aspects of AI-based Interview Scale(NAAIS), comprising 11 items targeting adverse perceptions linked to AI-based interviews. The outcomes of exploratory factor analysis unveiled three sub-constructs composing PAAIS labeled as 'comfortable,' 'convenient,' and 'fair,' while NAAIS exhibited dimensions of 'distrustful' and 'unpleasant.' Subsequently, in Study 2, it was discerned that students' attitudes towards AI-based interviews could be influenced through exposure to pertinent information concerning advanced AI technology or the underlying rationale behind such interviews. Notably, the absence of attitude alteration with respect to the 'societal trend' element underscores the perception that the principles governing recruitment and selection within corporate domains may not be seamlessly applicable to the university entrance examination domain due to differing contextual considerations.

REC_00766,Examining the moderating effect of motivation on technology acceptance of generative AI for English as a foreign language learning,"Grounded in the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), this study investigates the interplay between key UTAUT2 constructs and motivation modeled by Self-Determination Theory (SDT) in shaping English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners' behavioral intention and actual use of generative AI tools. Accordingly, three research questions were devised, including (1) What are the structural relationships between the UTAUT2 constructs for EFL learners to accept and use generative AI for English learning? (2) Does EFL learners' SDT motivation influence their behavioral intention toward and actual use of generative AI? and (3) What are the moderating effects of EFL learners' SDT motivation toward their acceptance and use of generative AI? A comprehensive survey involving 620 Chinese undergraduates assessed their technology acceptance and SDT motivation of generative AI tools in the EFL learning context. Confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling were employed to analyze the data. Results indicate robust model fit indices, both with and without considering moderating effects. Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, habit, and SDT motivation serve as significant predictors of EFL learners' behavioral intention towards generative AI tools, while price value does not demonstrate a significant impact on behavioral intention. Additionally, behavioral intention and SDT motivation jointly and significantly predict EFL learners' actual use of the technology. Importantly, introducing SDT motivation as a moderator unveils additional insights. Facilitating conditions exerts a significant influence on both behavioral intention and actual use, indicating a significant moderating effect of SDT moderation on these two pathways. Moreover, SDT motivation also significantly moderates the relationships between facilitating conditions and behavioral intention as well as between facilitating conditions and actual use, adding depth to our understanding of the nuanced interplay between motivation and technology acceptance of generative AI tools. The study concludes with insightful discussions on the findings, acknowledging the robust contributions and highlighting areas for future research to further enrich our understanding of EFL learners' adoption of generative AI tools in the context of UTAUT2 with SDT moderation.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.84,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14885,A comparative analysis between ChatGPT & Google as learning platforms: The role of mediators in the acceptance of learning platform,"Advancements in technology have had a profound impact on the way we learn, teach, and access knowledge. From online learning platforms to interactive educational games and virtual reality simulations, technology has transformed the traditional classroom into a dynamic, engaging, and inclusive space for education. One of the promising advancements in the field of artificial intelligence technology is ChatGPT which offers personalized and effective learning experiences by providing students with customized feedback and explanation. The effect of ChatGPT must be compared with the effect of Google at the educational level since both present a source of information and explanation. Thus, this study aims at investigating the differences between these two learning sources to measure their effectiveness from different perspectives. The model proposed in this study was evaluated using the PLS-SEM approach, utilizing data collected from 153 university students in the UAE. The results of this evaluation indicate that the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) has a significant impact on user acceptance, mediated by information quality, system quality, perceived learning value, and perceived satisfaction. These factors play a crucial role in determining users' acceptance of the GPT. However, it is important to note that some aspects of the model were not supported, suggesting that they do not have a significant predictive effect on the use of ChatGPT. Nonetheless, the findings of this study contribute to the existing literature on AI and environmental sustainability, providing valuable insights for practitioners, policymakers, and AI product developers. These insights can help guide the development and implementation of AI technologies in a way that aligns with users' needs and preferences while considering the larger environmental context. © 2024 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",2024,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.72,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07879,"Using explainable AI to unravel classroom dialogue analysis: Effects of explanations on teachers' trust, technology acceptance and cognitive load","Deep neural networks are increasingly employed to model classroom dialogue and provide teachers with prompt and valuable feedback on their teaching practices. However, these deep learning models often have intricate structures with numerous unknown parameters, functioning as black boxes. The lack of clear explanations regarding their classroom dialogue analysis likely leads teachers to distrust and underutilize these AI‐powered models. To tackle this issue, we leveraged explainable AI to unravel classroom dialogue analysis and conducted an experiment to evaluate the effects of explanations. Fifty‐nine pre‐service teachers were recruited and randomly assigned to either a treatment (n = 30) or control (n = 29) group. Initially, both groups learned to analyse classroom dialogue using AI‐powered models without explanations. Subsequently, the treatment group received both AI analysis and explanations, while the control group continued to receive only AI predictions. The results demonstrated that teachers in the treatment group exhibited significantly higher levels of trust in and technology acceptance of AI‐powered models for classroom dialogue analysis compared to those in the control group. Notably, there were no significant differences in cognitive load between the two groups. Furthermore, teachers in the treatment group expressed high satisfaction with the explanations. During interviews, they also elucidated how the explanations changed their perceptions of model features and attitudes towards the models. This study is among the pioneering works to propose and validate the use of explainable AI to address interpretability challenges within deep learning‐based models in the context of classroom dialogue analysis.

REC_02918,"Artificial intelligence readiness among healthcare students in Nigeria: A cross-sectional study assessing knowledge gaps, exposure, and adoption willingness","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming healthcare globally, yet its adoption in developing countries remains limited. As future practitioners, the readiness of healthcare students is crucial for successful AI integration, but this remains unexplored in the Nigerian context. Objectives: This study aimed to assess AI readiness among healthcare students at a major Nigerian university by evaluating their foundational knowledge, practical exposure, and willingness to adopt AI technologies in clinical practice. Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 551 healthcare students at Obafemi Awolowo University using a semi-structured, validated questionnaire. The instrument utilized distinct sections with open-ended questions to objectively measure AI knowledge, assess exposure to AI applications, and gauge attitudes toward AI adoption. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics and one-way ANOVA, with statistical significance set at p < 0.05. Results: A significant knowledge-perception paradox emerged: while 60 % of students believed they had high AI knowledge; objective assessment showed 92 % had low knowledge levels. Foundational concepts were poorly understood, with only 12 % correctly defining machine learning. Despite this, students expressed overwhelmingly positive attitudes, with 90.8 % believing AI would improve workflow efficiency and 84.4 % willing to undertake AI training. Practical exposure to AI was minimal, with electronic record keeping being the most frequently encountered application (43.4 %). Knowledge levels were significantly associated with willingness to adopt AI (p < 0.05), as students with higher knowledge showed greater confidence but also a more critical awareness of AI's limitations. Conclusion: Nigerian healthcare students show strong enthusiasm for AI adoption but have significant knowledge gaps and limited practical exposure. However, substantial concerns exist regarding the translation of expressed willingness into actual practice, particularly among early-year students who lack clinical exposure to understand AI limitations, bias, and real-world implementation challenges. These findings highlight an urgent need for AI curriculum integration and infrastructure development to prepare future healthcare professionals for an increasingly AI-driven healthcare landscape.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.73,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02942,Osteopathy educators' and researchers’ perspectives on artificial intelligence in academia: A cross-sectional study,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into healthcare education and research, yet little is known about how AI is perceived within osteopathy. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first cross-sectional study to examine AI perspectives specifically among osteopathic educators and researchers, providing fresh insights into technology adoption within this healthcare discipline. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between December 2023 and February 2024 among osteopathic educators and/or researchers through snowball sampling. The survey collected data on AI-related knowledge, usage in educational and research contexts, attitudes toward AI, perceived risks, and necessities challenges. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to validate the structure of the survey. Demographic factors such as age, gender, occupation, and academic qualifications were analysed in relation to scores. Results: 190 respondents from 18 countries completed the survey. Participants demonstrated positive attitudes toward the role of AI in education and research, but acknowledged limited proficiency in its use. Usage of AI was higher among younger, male participants, with AI primarily used for personal organisation and research. Concerns about AI included risks of bias, over-reliance on technology, and potential replacement of human judgment. Participants with educational roles expressed fewer concerns about AI's risks compared to those outside of education. Knowledge of AI was not correlated with demographic factors, but attitudes and concerns about risks varied with age. Conclusion: Osteopathic educators and researchers view AI as a beneficial tool for teaching and research, but face challenges in its effective implementation due to concerns about technology replacing human expertise and biases. Training, institutional support, and ethical guidelines are essential to foster the responsible integration of AI in osteopathy. Implications for practice: ● AI is underutilised in osteopathic education and research despite positive attitudes towards its potential. ● Educators are less concerned about AI risks, positioning them as key facilitators of responsible assimilation. ● Institutional policies should provide clear AI usage guidelines while addressing ethical and validity concerns. ● AI should support, not replace, human expertise, ensuring critical thinking remains central in education and research. © 2025",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.57,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07883,"Analysing nontraditional students' ChatGPT interaction, engagement, self-efficacy and performance: A mixed-methods approach","Generative artificial intelligence brings opportunities and unique challenges to nontraditional higher education students, stemming, in part, from the experience of the digital divide. Providing access and practice is critical to bridge this divide and equip students with needed digital competencies. This mixed-methods study investigated how nontraditional higher education students interact with ChatGPT in multiple courses and examined relationships between ChatGPT interactions, engagement, self-efficacy and performance. Data were collected from 73 undergraduate and graduate students through chat logs, course reflections and artefacts, surveys and interviews. ChatGPT interactions were analysed using four metrics: prompt number, depth of knowledge (DoK), prompt relevance and originality. Results showed that ChatGPT prompt numbers (beta = 0.256, p < 0.03) and engagement (beta = 0.267, p < 0.05) significantly predicted performance, while self-efficacy did not. Students' DoK (r = 0.40, p < 0.01) and prompt relevance (r = 0.42, p < 0.01) were positively correlated with performance. Text mining analysis identified distinct interaction patterns, with 'strategic inquirers' demonstrating significantly higher performance than 'exploratory inquirers' through more sophisticated follow-up questioning. Qualitative findings revealed that while most students were first-time ChatGPT users who initially showed resistance, they developed growing acceptance. Still, students tended to use ChatGPT sparingly and, even then, as only a starting point for assignments.

REC_11382,Undergraduate Intentions of Generative Artificial Intelligence for Enhanced Learning: Influence of Attitude and Perceived Behavioral Control,"Education 4.0 increasingly relies on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) to personalize learning experiences and provide personalized tools that improve student engagement and comprehension. Its capacity for analyzing enormous volumes of data enables educators to design adaptable lessons that satisfy the various demands of students in a society that is becoming increasingly digitalized and interconnected. This study examines GenAI’s undergraduate intentions for enhanced learning from the planned behavior theory (PBT) perspective. Based on the convenience sampling technique, an online survey was conducted, and 122 undergraduates attending a Nigerian public university responded to the same. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the data collected for measurement and structural model assessment. Evaluation of the measurement model revealed the reliability and validity of the factor loading and the constructs, while the structural model assessment was used to test the hypotheses, the effects of the paths, and the model’s predictive relevance. The result shows that attitudes toward GenAI do not influence its actual use among undergraduates but rather influence intention to use GenAI. Furthermore, the intention to use GenAI influences its actual use. In addition, perceived control concerning GenAI influences the intention to use and the actual use of GenAI. However, subjective norms concerning GenAI do not influence the intention to use GenAI. PBT core factors positively influence undergraduate intent to use GenAI, and behavioral intention influences the actual use of GenAI. This study stresses the need for motivating components like perceived behavioral control (PBC) in determining intention and actual use of GenAI. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

However, few studies explored how external and internal factors jointly shape FL learners' well-being in the era of generative AI. To fill this gap, this study explores the effects of generative AI acceptance, perceived teachers' enthusiasm and self-efficacy on FL learners' well-being by investigating 613 university learners of English as a foreign language (EFL). The structural equation modelling results reveal that (1) generative AI acceptance positively predicts EFL learners' well-being and self-efficacy; (2) perceived teachers' enthusiasm does not predict learners' well-being and positively predicts EFL learners' self-efficacy; and (3) the self-efficacy for receptive skills mediates the relationship between generative AI acceptance/perceived teachers' enthusiasm and EFL learners' well-being, whereas self-efficacy for productive skills does not play the mediation role. This research broadens the understanding of the antecedents of EFL learners' well-being and extends the application of self-efficacy theory in the AI-driven educational environment, providing significant pedagogical implications.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.85,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12174,IMPACT OF ISLAMIC BELIEFS ON TECHNOLOGY ANXIETY AND ATTITUDE TOWARDS AI: ROLE OF RELIGION AS END AND PERCEIVED RISK OF TECHNOLOGY,"Purpose: This study examines the impact of Islamic beliefs on AI-based system attitudes, considering the mediating role of technology anxiety and the moderating roles of perceived technology risk and religion as an end. As AI is being used more and more in every aspect of life, it is crucial to understand how religious beliefs shape perceptions of AI so that AI adoption can be made ethical and culturally appropriate. Method: A quantitative design was employed, and data were collected from 228 university students with a standardized questionnaire. Established measures from the literature were used to operationalize the variables of interest. Structural equation modeling (SEM) through AMOS was applied to test the direct, indirect, and moderating effects within the conceptualized framework. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was used to determine the reliability and validity of the constructs. Findings: The results showed that Islamic beliefs play a major role in influencing students' attitudes towards AI-based systems. Technology anxiety partly mediates the relationship, revealing that religious beliefs influence emotional and cognitive responses to AI. Perceived technology risk and religion as an end also moderate the relationship, which shows that contextual and intrinsic religious factors shape AI perceptions. Originality/Implications: This study enriches AI adoption theories by integrating religious and psychological variables. Findings make theoretical contributions to technology acceptance theory and practical implications for AI developers, educators, and policymakers aiming to improve culturally responsive AI integration. © (2025), (European Journal for Philosophy of Religion).

REC_14207,Mobile-Assisted Language Learning to Support English Language Communication among Higher Education Learners in Thailand,"The ability to use English has become essential for functioning in the 21st century; not only the basic skills (reading, writing, listening, and speaking) but broader skills in communication and collaboration will be necessary for future success in global environments. Digital transformation in learning via mobile devices helps create authenticity in English language education. They can interest and engage learners, both in and out of the classrooms, while promoting uninterrupted learning, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, advances in mobile applications and virtual learning environments have become important components of developing English language skills, allowing for asynchronous learning in convenient, flexible, and interactive environments on any of a learner’s devices. This paper reports the results of using a mobile-assisted language learning interactive environment (MALLIE), a chatbot-based application, to support the development of English language communication skills. Quantitative data were acquired from 546 higher education learners in Thailand. The information was used for the exploratory factor analysis which shall serve as a baseline for innovation development. The study briefly examined the students’ experiences with any type of mobile learning before focusing on the students’ and a group of experts’ ratings of the intervention in this study. Preliminary studies were conducted with 10 students and experts to identify factors they believed were most relevant for measuring the effectiveness of the MALLIE for English language learning in a virtual learning environment. Exploratory factor analysis of 70 variables extracted four factors with loadings that exceeded .30: MALL, VLE (virtual learning environment), 4Cs for the four basic components of language learning, and ELCS for English language communication skills; the factor loadings ranged between 0.55 and 0.81. Additionally, in-depth interviews were conducted to collect qualitative data, and the results of preliminary studies were used to design and develop the MALLIE application and test its learning effectiveness. Next, an opinion survey was administered related to a group of 105 students and experts regarding their acceptance of the MALLIE and their intentions to use it or something similar in the future; the main topics of the survey related to the perceived usefulness of the MALLIE, its ease of use, respondents’ attitudes towards its use, peer influences on respondents’ use, and respondents’ use behaviour and intention to use. The aim of the study’s surveys and analyses was to assess the effectiveness and efficiency of learning the English language via mobile language learning applications available for use on any device. © The Authors.",2023,Scopus; WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.69,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11428,Artificial Intelligence in Higher Education: A Cross-Cultural Examination of Students’ Behavioral Intentions and Attitudes,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has undergone considerable advancement in the contemporary period and represents an emerging technology in higher education. Cultural contexts significantly shape individuals’ perceptions, attitudes, and behaviors, particularly in the realm of technology acceptance. By adopting a cross-cultural lens, this research explores the potential variations across Chinese and international students from diverse countries in terms of attitudes and their behavioral intentions toward AI use. With a technology acceptance model (TAM) framework, the research used a survey approach, employing questionnaires as the primary means of data collection. The data were then analyzed through structural equation modeling and descriptive statistics. A substantial discrepancy was found in the prevalence, attitudes, and behavioral intentions toward AI use between Chinese and international students. Findings further revealed a stronger effect of perceived ease of use on both attitudes and behavioral intentions among international students compared with their Chinese counterparts. Findings suggest that cultural backgrounds and prior technological exposure play intricate roles in shaping perceptions of AI technology. The study emphasizes the need for tailored educational strategies to regulate diverse cultural perspectives, provide language-specific support, and ensure user-friendly interfaces. These insights contribute to the evolving discourse on technology acceptance in higher education and offer practical implications for educators and institutions toward optimizing AI integration in pedagogical practices. © 2024, Athabasca University.

REC_14209,Determinants of Student Adoption of Generative AI in Higher Education,"The examination of the impact of Generative AI (GenAI) on higher education, especially from the viewpoint of students, is gaining significance. Although prior research has underscored GenAI's potential advantages in higher education, there exists a discernible research gap concerning the determinants that affect its adoption. In the present study, we aim to enhance our comprehension of the factors influencing the willingness of higher education students to adopt GenAI tools. To achieve this, we have developed an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model incorporating specific GenAI constructs. Our research methodology entailed the selection of a diverse sample of 374 students through random sampling. We then analyzed their data using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to gain insights into the complex relationships between various variables. The study found that students are more likely to use GenAI tools when they view them as supplemental resource and effort expectancy. It also revealed that perceived costs negatively impact adoption intentions, highlighting that financial factors are a significant barrier. Interestingly, Factors like information accuracy and hedonic motivation did not significantly affect students' adoption intentions. This study offers key insights for eLearning practitioners on integrating Generative AI (GenAI) tools into educational settings. It emphasizes the significance of resource perception and effort expectancy, demonstrating GenAI's potential to personalize learning experiences. eLearning platforms can utilize GenAI to enhance active learning through engaging methods and streamline course development. Addressing cost barriers is crucial for equitable access and inclusivity. A gradual approach to integration aligned with learning objectives is recommended, along with fostering critical engagement with GenAI tools to enhance digital literacy. Lastly, the study is constrained by its specific context, potential biases in self-reported data, a narrow focus on factors influencing students' intent to use GenAI tools and a cross-sectional design. Future research should encompass a broader range of factors, employ objective measures, and integrate observational data. Longitudinal studies or experimental designs could offer more comprehensive insights into how students' perceptions and intentions develop, thus promoting a more inclusive educational environment for all students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.86,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07981,Giving Away the Immersive L2 Learning Experiences in GenAI-Mediated Contexts: The Contributions of Cognitive and Affective Factors,"Immersive learning plays a crucial role in effective second language (L2) acquisition, but many learners face limited opportunities to interact with native speakers. While existing research highlights the importance of immersion in L2 learning, there is still a gap in understanding how Generative AI (GenAI) can provide greater access to such immersive environments. This study aims to address this gap by exploring the factors influencing immersion in GenAI-mediated L2 learning. Drawing upon the cognitive-affective model of immersive learning, the control-value theory, and the technology acceptance model, the study examined the impact of cognitive factors (e.g., perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness) and affective factors (e.g., enjoyment and boredom) on immersion, using a sample of 460 Chinese college L2 learners. Structural equation modelling with Amos 24 was applied to analyse the data, yielding several key findings. (i) Perceived ease of use positively predicted perceived usefulness and enjoyment but had no direct effect on immersion or boredom. (ii) Perceived usefulness positively influenced immersion and enjoyment while negatively affecting boredom. (iii) Enjoyment was a positive predictor of immersion, whereas boredom had no significant effect. (iv) Mediation analysis revealed that perceived ease of use indirectly predicted immersion through perceived usefulness and enjoyment but not through boredom or in combination with perceived usefulness. The study concludes with implications for practice and suggestions for future research.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.48,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05920,"Artificial intelligence as an assistive technology in language education: investigating TPACK, self-efficacy, and organisational support","This study investigates how Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) influences Artificial Intelligence Acceptance (AIA) among Chinese university English teachers, focusing on the dual mediating roles of organisational support and self-efficacy. Drawing on structural equation modelling of survey data from 153 instructors, the results show that TPACK significantly predicts AIA, with self-efficacy accounting for this relationship. Drawing on a structural equation model analysis of survey data from 153 English instructors, we demonstrate that TPACK significantly predicts AIA, and self-efficacy played an explanatory role in this relationship. Organisational support further mediates the pathway from AI-Technical Knowledge (AI-TK) to TPACK, highlighting institutional mechanisms that strengthen teachers' pedagogical capacity for AI integration. Three critical pathways are identified: (1) a direct TPACK -> AIA trajectory, (2) an AI-TK -> OS -> TPACK -> AIA institutional chain and (3) a TPACK -> SE -> AIA motivational loop. Positioning AI as a form of assistive technology, the findings highlight its role in enhancing teachers' instructional capacity while promoting accessibility, personalised scaffolding and inclusive opportunities for diverse learners. By integrating Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and assistive technology perspectives, the study reframes TPACK as interaction readiness, organisational support as a socio-technical affordance, and self-efficacy as interaction efficacy. This interdisciplinary framing highlights that AI acceptance is not only a matter of knowledge and psychology, but also of designing human-AI collaborations that promote usability, accessibility and inclusive pedagogy. The results offer actionable implications for AI training programs, highlighting the importance of integrating technical upskilling with organisational mechanisms.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14246,Battle of AI chatbots: Graduate students’ perceptions of ChatGPT versus Gemini for learning purposes in Egyptian higher education,"The rapid developments of AI chatbots since the inauguration of ChatGPT in November 2022 have had significant impacts on higher education. The war between various AI chatbots is growing with many consequences on students’ learning journey. This study delves into this battle of AI chatbots in higher education and examines graduate students’ perceptions of ChatGPT versus Gemini, the most commonly used AI chatbots, for learning purposes. The research undertook a sequential mixed method approach with two stages of study. The first stage adopted a pretested survey using the UTAUT framework to explore graduate students’ perceptions of ChatGPT versus Gemini for learning purposes in a sample of Egyptian higher education institutions. The results informed the second stage of a qualitative study, which included in-depth interviews with a sample of graduate students who completed the survey to probe their answers and delve into the differences between these AI chatbots. Statistical SEM results using AMOS software (version 25) showed positive perceptions among graduate students’ of ChatGPT and Gemini, which significantly affected their behavioral intention and actual usage of both AI chatbots for learning purposes. However, the results of Gemini’s structural model showed more acceptance; hence, higher intention and usage than those of ChatGPT. The results of interviews showed more acceptance of Gemini over ChatGPT among graduate students with some reasons specific to the Egyptian context. Students confirmed a lack of institutional support to integrate AI for learning reasons and confirmed that their use of AI chatbots is their own choice and responsibility with informal support from their tutors. The findings of this study suggested some implications for academics and policymakers in the higher education context in order to best use these AI tools in education. © 2025. Abu Elnasr E.

In the rapidly evolving field of GAI education, understanding how students' existing TL, IL, and satisfaction influence their adoption of ChatGPT is essential. Yet the role of these individual constructs in shaping ChatGPT adoption for learning, knowledge acquisition, and knowledge dissemination remains inadequately investigated. In response, this research integrates Cognitive Load Theory as fundamental for TL & IL, and satisfaction into the traditional Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework to probe and validate its applicability in inducing students' adoption intention of ChatGPT for learning, knowledge acquisition, and dissemination. Data were acquired from 620 university students in China via a self-administered questionnaire and analyzed through structural equation modeling (SEM) with SmartPLS. The study discovered that the core UTAUT constructs (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions) significantly enhance student satisfaction with ChatGPT, while social influence and satisfaction robustly drive their adoption. Furthermore, TL and IL directly affect satisfaction and adoption, as well as moderate the association between satisfaction and the intention to adopt ChatGPT. These findings offer valuable theoretical contributions (extended UTAUT with TL, IL, and satisfaction as moderating constructs resulting in the validated UTAUT-TLILS model, where PE, EE, and FC along with TL and IL accounted for 59.8% variance in satisfaction) and practical implications (highlights the need for universities and institutions to strategically make TL and IL courses mandatory by integrating it in educational curriculum systems, teaching and relevant subject settings) for the effective utilization of ChatGPT among students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.76,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

This study aimed to investigate the impact of using a newly developed ChatBot to learn Chinese vocabulary by comparing how it works in different learning environments and to explore the ChatBot with reference to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). This study was conducted with 58 students divided into two independent groups. The control group used ChatBot in a one-on-many classroom. The experimental group applied the ChatBot in one-on-one tutor sessions. A pretest and a posttest were used to measure the effect of the ChatBot, while TAM was explored through questionnaire and interview. Data analysis includes a paired-sample t test, analysis of covariance, and levels of effect. The results indicated that the ChatBot significantly improved the students’ learning achievement and that having a one-on-one environment may lead to better outcome than what could be achieved in a classroom. The TAM model was tested using partial least square. The result showed that perceived usefulness was the predictor of behavioral intention, whereas perceived ease of use was not. The students agreed that the ChatBot benefited their learning of Chinese vocabulary, with several adjustments need to be made for further progress.

REC_06031,Investigating the adoption of AI in higher education: a study of public universities in Indonesia,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) influences many activities and aspects of daily life including the higher education environment. AI in education has become vital for educators and researchers. There is a rising debate regarding the positive advantages and how higher education institutions adapt to changes in the learning perspectives of students. Educators use the implementation of AI in higher education to guide teachers, improve instructional systems, and make administrative decisions that shape higher education policy. The purpose of this research is to investigate how educators and policymakers can utilize AI and adapt it to the learning aspect. A total of 351 respondents participated in an online survey, and the proposed hypotheses were evaluated using a structural equation model (SEM-PLS). The study revealed that (1) users' attitudes toward the adoption of AI are positively influenced by performance expectancy and effort expectancy, and negatively influenced by perceived risk; (2) Facilitating Conditions exert a positive influence on Effort Expectancy, but a negative influence on Behavioral Intention; (3) Users' attitudes toward the adoption of AI have a positive impact on behavioral intention; and (4) Behavioral intention positively influences the adoption of AI in higher education. The model is expected to assist policymakers in accelerating the acceptance of AI in higher education.

REC_06032,An exploratory study of artificial intelligence adoption in higher education,"Higher education has seen substantial changes with the growing integration of computer-based intelligence technologies into the learning process. Nevertheless, the acceptance of computer-based intelligence in advanced educational settings is still faced with various difficulties, including perceived dangers, implementation assumptions, and exertion assumptions. This exploration plans to determine the relationship between risk policies, implementation assumptions, and effort assumptions with social expectations regarding the acceptance of computer-based intelligence innovations in advanced educational organizations in North Sulawesi, Indonesia. Moreover, this exploration also tests the role of social goals as a mediator variable connecting these elements. As a research method, a survey was conducted using a survey of students and academic staff from various universities in North Sulawesi with a sample size of 330 people with different educational backgrounds. The research results show that risk perception, performance expectations, and effort expectations have a large influence on behavioral intentions to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education. In addition, this study found that behavioral intention acts as a moderator that moderates the relationship between perceived risks, performance expectations; while effort expectations through behavioral intentions do not have a significant influence on AI adoption. These results provide valuable insights for higher education institutions in planning AI adoption strategies, with a focus on managing perceived risk, increasing performance expectations, and reducing effort expectations. In addition, this research also highlights the large role of recognizing behavioral intentions in the process of adopting AI technology in higher education, so that it can increase the effectiveness of its implementation.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.57,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12310,Decoding EFL Learners’ Intention to Use ChatGPT for Academic Writing: Cognitive and Emotional Drivers,"ChatGPT, a groundbreaking open artificial intelligence technological development, is revolutionizing academic writing practice across the globe. The effectiveness of technology integration in language learning depends on learners’ attitudes toward it. Hence, the current research investigated Bangladeshi English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners’ cognitive and affective attitudes and their behavioral intentions to utilize ChatGPT for academic writing. The study was conducted among 159 first-year students in Bangladeshi public and private universities. Data were collected by implementing a Likert scale questionnaire. The study used a quantitative approach to explore individual relationships between cognitive and affective attitudes and behavioral intentions. Also, it probed the mediating role of affective and cognitive attitudes on their relationship with behavioral intention. The Pearson correlation coefficient, multiple regression analysis, and bootstrapping were used for data analysis. Findings reveal that both cognitive and affective attitudes, as independent constructs, significantly influenced the EFL learners’ behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT for academic writing. Cognitive and affective attitudes significantly predicted EFL learners’ intentions to use ChatGPT in academic writing, and the affective attitude was found to be the stronger predictor. Results indicate that affective attitude moderately mediates the relationship between cognitive attitude and behavioral intentions. Likewise, cognitive attitude has a moderate influence on the relationship between affective attitude and behavioral intention to use ChatGPT for EFL academic writing. The study suggests that educators promote the use of ChatGPT in academic writing as a cognitive and emotional support tool. Education policymakers are recommended to create a supportive environment for fostering positive attitudes to ChatGPT as an academic writing tool. ©Authors.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.84,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09105,Generational Divide in AI Adoption for Academic Writing: Evidence From Serbian Social Scientists,"This cross-sectional study examines a generational divide in the adoption of AI for academic writing among academic researchers in Serbia. A survey of 823 social scientists analyzed usage patterns and measured age-related adoption rates through logistic regression analysis. The findings indicate that 27.2% of researchers employ AI for academic writing, with adoption rates varying significantly by age: 42.9% of researchers in their twenties use these tools, compared to 14.3% of those in their sixties. Researchers aged 23-34 were twice as likely to adopt AI writing tools as those aged 49-80. Each additional year of age reduced the odds of AI adoption by 3.8%, even when controlled for academic title, sex, and workplace type. This age effect persisted while gender and institutional context showed no significant association with adoption. The significant variation in AI adoption across age groups suggests potential shifts in academia. Senior faculty who avoid AI writing tools cannot effectively mentor graduate students who rely on them. Manuscripts now face inconsistent peer review standards; reviewers familiar with AI-assisted writing apply different criteria than those who reject it entirely. Universities face competing demands: junior researchers insist AI tools help them publish enough to secure tenure, yet senior faculty argue that students who depend on these tools never learn to construct arguments or evaluate evidence independently.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.72,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08053,What Drives University Students to Use ChatGPT for Translation? Disciplinary and Experiential Influences,"The increasing use of large language models like ChatGPT has sparked interest in their potential for translation tasks. However, little is known about what drives university students to adopt these tools or how disciplinary background and prior experience shape their decisions. Guided by the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), this study explores the adoption of ChatGPT for translation tasks among university students in Hong Kong. Survey responses from 308 students, including translation and non-translation majors, were analyzed using structural equation modeling. Results show that performance expectancy is the strongest determinant of adoption intention, followed by facilitating conditions, while effort expectancy and social influence were less significant. Experience level emerged as an important moderating factor: novice users relied on both social influence and performance expectations, whereas experienced users prioritized performance alone. Disciplinary differences were also pronounced. Translation students primarily valued performance benefits and used their technical expertise to evaluate ChatGPT independently. Non-translation students, however, were influenced by both performance expectations and facilitating conditions, suggesting a greater need for institutional support. These findings highlight the importance of tailored educational approaches that address the specific motivations of different student populations. For translation students, this means emphasizing advanced features and critical evaluation, while for non-translation students, it involves providing stronger support systems and guidance.

Contribution To the best of our knowledge, this is the first reported study that contributes to understanding the KAP of students and faculty towards ChatGPT, as well as the readiness of faculty to effectively adopt AI -driven conversational models. Furthermore, our research contributes to the body of knowledge by taking Vygotsky's (1978) principle of social interaction and its role in promoting cogni- tive development to a new level by hypothesizing that if students were to ac- quire the competencies to actively engage with AI -driven chatbots in meaning- ful discussions and collaborative conversations, they might be able to develop some higher -order thinking skills further. Findings Our results indicated that faculty demonstrated a higher level of ChatGPT knowledge than students and that more than 40% of surveyed students and fac- ulty expressed some trust in the reliability of ChatGPT's responses, a perception that does not align with reality. Faculty attitude towards ChatGPT was compar- atively more reserved compared to that of students and showcased varying opinions. Furthermore, the surveyed faculty showcased a more negative percep- tion of ChatGPT than students, and they expressed a greater degree of skepti- cism. Our research revealed that 63.4% of surveyed faculty reported that they lack the requisite training and resources to integrate ChatGPT into their peda- gogical practices. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers HEIs should take appropriate measures to enhance students' and faculty's knowledge, attitude, and perception regarding ChatGPT to stimulate ethical, meaningful, innovative, and engaging interactions and learning experiences. Our study has shed light on some moderating factors that shape the acceptance of AI -driven conversational models and some adoption barriers. It delves into the perceptions, biases, and misconceptions held by both students and faculty, thereby providing a basis for future investigations on the effective integration of AI -driven conversational models in higher education. Impact on Society This research provides new insights that can harness the potential merits of ChatGPT in enhancing students' learning while mitigating potential pitfalls. It suggests facilitating open forums and dialogues among students, faculty, em- ployers, and other key stakeholders to debate the impact of AI -driven conversa- tional models on students' learning and faculty's teaching and assessment. Future Research We invite researchers to conduct cross-cultural studies on this topic while also taking into consideration a qualitative research design approach. Future research can also test the hypothesis that AI -driven conversational models inhibit critical thinking by facilitating the passive consumption of information.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.78,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_06044,Analysing the built environment academics' perceptions of generative AI technology on teaching and learning practice,"The study examines the influence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technology on teaching and learning within the built environment discipline from the perspective of academics. It explores the relationships between academics' experience, AI knowledge, willingness to adopt AI technologies and their capacity to detect student use of AI. A mixed-methods approach was employed, incorporating qualitative interviews and quantitative surveys with built environment academics. A web scraping technique was used to obtain the contact details of potential research participants for purposive sampling, resulting in a sample of 56 participants from 42 UK universities offering built environment education. Cram & eacute;r's V coefficient was applied to analyse the relationships between the variables. The findings suggest that academics' experience significantly affects their adoption of AI, their preparedness to adapt assessments and their ability to detect AI use by students.

Methodology/approach - Probit regression analysis comparing users versus nonusers of online accounting tutoring software, as well as analysis of student achievement pre and post-technology adoption over a 10-year period. Findings - We confirm prior research findings that the number of terms that have transpired since a student took introductory financial accounting, whether they took the course at a two-year college, or if they needed to repeat the introductory course, are all negatively associated with performance in intermediate accounting. We find evidence that an online tutoring system, ALEKS r, helps moderate these negative correlations. Results suggest that in upper division courses where student knowledge of underlying basic material is uneven, online tutors are an effective tool in bringing students up to an equal level of competence without sacrificing class time. Practical implications - Provides empirical evidence on the usefulness of online accounting software as a review tool in intermediate accounting.

Results demonstrated that the 12-item FAAI scale comprises 3-dimension: utility-knowledge, value-expression, and ego-defense, with good validity, reliability, and measurement invariance across majors and genders. Moreover, UTAUT was positively correlated with utility-knowledge and value-expression, but not with ego-defense. Neuroticism is associated with greater concern and defense against AI, while openness is linked to positive attitudes. Subgroup differences emerged, with males stronger in value-expression and females in ego-defense; AI experience enhanced utility-knowledge function; STEM students showed lower ego-defense and value-expression, and rural students outperformed urban ones in these aspects.

REC_00922,Generative AI in Action: Acceptance and Use Among Higher Education Staff Pre- and Post-training,"The adoption of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) in higher education (HE) has led to an urgent need to foster genAI literacy among staff. Thus, we drew on a genAI introductory course for staff at a major university college in Norway to examine, through a one-group pre-/post-test design, if participation was associated with an increased genAI acceptance, i.e. intention to use genAI tools. We posed five hypotheses based on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) and the Artificial Intelligence Attitude Scale (AIAS) to explore the predictive relationship between pre- and post-course genAI acceptance, the moderating effects of demographic and experiential variables, and changes in the underlying factors of genAI acceptance over time. Through PLS-SEM we discovered that Habit and AI attitudes were significant predictors of genAI acceptance at the beginning (T1), but that none of the examined variables significantly predicted genAI acceptance at the end of the course (T2). Behavioral intentions at T1 did not significantly predict Behavioral intentions at T2, either. However, the UTAUT2 factors combined with AI attitudes explained 79.5% of the variance in genAI acceptance at T1 and 82.4% at T2. Neither gender, age, experience with genAI, nor teaching position moderated the relationship between genAI acceptance at T1 and T2. Last, but not least we found a significant and large increase in genAI use from T1 to T2. Similarly, all UTAUT2 predictor variables significantly increased while AI attitudes did not. Our study is the first to implement a pre-/post-test design utilizing the UTAUT2 framework among HE staff. Our findings suggest that course participation is associated with changes in prior acceptance and intention patterns, potentially reducing disparities in familiarity and use, thereby facilitating professional development within a collegial community.

REC_07680,ReAct!: An Interactive Educational Tool for AI Planning for Robotics,"This paper presents ReAct!, an interactive educational tool for artificial intelligence (AI) planning for robotics. ReAct! enables students to describe robots' actions and change in dynamic domains without first having to know about the syntactic and semantic details of the underlying formalism, and to solve planning problems using state-of-the-art reasoners without having to know about their input/output language or usage. In particular, ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. ReAct! also allows the embedding of externally defined calculations (e.g., checking for collision-free continuous trajectories) into domain representations of hybrid domains that require a tight integration of (discrete) high-level reasoning with (continuous) geometric reasoning. ReAct! also allows students to solve planning problems that involve complex temporal goals. This broad applicability, and the intelligent interactive user interface, mean that students can work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive factories, leading to hands-on robotic applications. The efficacy of ReAct! was evaluated from three different points of view: 1) the course outcomes that demonstrate its utility in achieving the learning objectives of a research-oriented cognitive robotics course; 2) the user friendliness and usefulness of ReAct! for students, as evaluated by quantitative student surveys; and 3) instructors' experience of teaching the course either with or without ReAct!.",2015,IEEE,exclude,uncertain,0.81,0.5,E5,,"The abstract indicates a quantitative educational evaluation of an AI planning tool, but it does not clearly report adoption/acceptance constructs or any correlation matrix/standardized beta/path coefficients needed for meta-analytic effect extraction.

However, since its introduction, ChatGPT remains relatively unexplored in terms of health profession students' acceptance of its use in education and practice.DesignThis study employed a mixed-methods approach, using a web-based survey.MethodsThe study involved a convenience sample recruited through various methods, including Faculty of Medicine announcements, social media, and snowball sampling, during the second semester (March to June 2023). Data were collected using a structured questionnaire with closed-ended questions and three open-ended questions. The final sample comprised 217 undergraduate health profession students, including 73 (33.6%) nursing students, 65 (30.0%) medical students, and 79 (36.4%) occupational therapy, physiotherapy, and speech therapy students.ResultsAmong the surveyed students, 86.2% were familiar with ChatGPT, with generally positive perceptions as reflected by a mean score of 4.04 (SD = 0.62) on a scale of 1 to 5. Positive feedback was particularly noted with respect to ChatGPT's role in information retrieval and summarization. The qualitative data revealed three main themes: experiences with ChatGPT, its impact on the quality of healthcare, and its integration into the curriculum. The findings highlight benefits such as serving as a convenient tool for accessing information, reducing human errors, and fostering innovative learning approaches. However, they also underscore areas of concern, including ethical considerations, challenges in fostering critical thinking, and issues related to verification. The absence of significant differences between the different fields of study indicates consistent perceptions across nursing, medicine, and other health profession students.ConclusionsOur findings underscore the necessity for continuous refinement to enhance ChatGPT's accuracy, reliability, and alignment with the diverse educational needs of health professions.

Through a qualitative elicitation procedure, 26 salient beliefs were identified, representing procurement and approval goals, advantages and disadvantages, the social influence, and factors facilitating and hindering ethical use of ChatGPT. A subsequent, two-wave quantitative survey provided promising evidence for the theory, revealing that positive attitudes and subjective norms emerged as key antecedents of motivation to use ChatGPT ethically. Likewise, motivation and perceived behavioural control were strong predictors of intentions to do so. The study discusses the implications for future research regarding this timely issue. It emphasizes the potential of these findings in developing effective interventions that encourage ethical use of large language models within tertiary education.

REC_05505,What influences ChatGPT's adoption and diffusion in Chinese higher education? A study based on Technology-Organization-Environment framework,"Artificial intelligence technologies represented by ChatGPT are developing rapidly and sparking controversies in fields such as education. To gain insight into the factors influencing the adoption and diffusion of ChatGPT in Chinese higher education, we utilize the Technology-Organization-Environment framework as our theoretical perspective. We surveyed 440 teachers from six higher education institutions to explore the factors that affect the spread of ChatGPT in higher education. Using a questionnaire, we investigated a range of factors across the technology, organization, and environment dimensions that influence the diffusion of ChatGPT in higher education. By employing statistical tests and AMOS 26.0 software, we analyzed how technical, organizational, and environmental variables impact teachers' willingness to adopt ChatGPT. Our findings reveal that policies and regulations, teachers' needs, campus guidance atmosphere, security considerations, technical advantages, management support, and organizational readiness significantly shape ChatGPT's adoption. However, factors like professional training and compatibility hold limited influence. Additionally, gender and teaching experience did not exhibit significant difference in ChatGPT adoption among teachers, whereas their educational and disciplinary backgrounds did influence their attitudes. Based on these findings, we propose recommendations for policymakers, educational institutions, and AI tools developers to foster a more conducive environment for the integration of AI technologies in teaching and learning.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,include,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13124,"Using knowledge of, attitude toward, and daily preventive practices for COVID-19 to predict the level of post-traumatic stress and vaccine acceptance among adults in Hong Kong","Introduction: COVID-19 has been perceived as an event triggering a new type of post-traumatic stress (PTSD) that can live during and after the pandemic itself. However, it remains unclear whether such PTSD is partly related to people’s knowledge of, attitude toward and daily behavioral practices (KAP) for COVID-19. Methods: Through a telephone survey, we collected responses from 3,011 adult Hong Kong residents. Then using the Catboost machine learning method, we examined whether KAP predicted the participant’s PTSD level, vaccine acceptance and participation in voluntary testing. Results: Results suggested that having good preventative practices for, poor knowledge of, and negative attitude toward COVID-19 were associated with greater susceptibility to PTSD. Having a positive attitude and good compliance with preventative practices significantly predicted willingness to get vaccinated and participate in voluntary testing. Good knowledge of COVID-19 predicted engagement in testing but showed little association with vaccine acceptance. Discussion: To maintain good mental health and ongoing vaccine acceptance, it is important to foster people’s sense of trust and belief in health professionals’ and government’s ability to control COVID-19, in addition to strengthening people’s knowledge of and compliance with preventative measures.

This study explores the factors that influence university and graduate students' intentions to use ChatGPT, an AI-powered system, by integrating Cognitive Load Theory and the Theory of Planned Behavior. This dual-theoretical approach is relatively novel, offering a comprehensive understanding of how different cognitive load types-intrinsic, extraneous, and germane-affect students' perceived behavioral control, behavioral attitudes, and behavioral intention toward ChatGPT. We surveyed 573 participants, obtaining 518 valid responses. The findings indicate that higher intrinsic cognitive load reduces students' behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT, while perceived behavioral control significantly moderates this relationship, suggesting that students' self-efficacy can mitigate the negative impact of high cognitive load. Additionally, germane cognitive load positively influences students' behavioral attitudes toward ChatGPT, which, in turn, enhances their behavioral intention. However, extraneous cognitive load does not have a significant effect on behavioral intention.

This paper empirically examined the issue of ChatGPT usage for writing homework from the perspectives of students and professors. Study research methods included both quantitative and qualitative approaches. In Study 1, an anonymous questionnaire was administered to 350 Croatian students, users of ChatGPT, to investigate their perceptions, attitudes, habits, and intentions regarding ChatGPT usage for homework assignments. In Study 2, twelve faculty members were tested on their accuracy of distinguishing between original students’ papers and ChatGPT-generated papers. For this purpose, 25 different versions of papers for 8 different courses were prepared. The results of the students’ survey showed that most students still do not use ChatGPT regularly and have neutral attitudes about its usefulness, ease of use, risks, and intentions for future use. In addition, they were moderately concerned about ethical issues around its usage. Differences across gender and field of study were found. Professors, on the other hand, reported having average self-efficacy in appraising authorship, which is in line with their low average accuracy of 53%. Accuracy in distinguishing was lowest when ChatGPT was instructed to write a paper as a student.

REC_05513,AI literacy as a key driver of user experience in AI-powered assessment: insights from Socratic mind,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools become increasingly embedded in higher education, their effective integration remains uneven, and their potential to improve learning outcomes is not yet fully realized. AI literacy has emerged as a key factor influencing whether students can engage effectively with these tools. This study investigates how students' AI literacy and prior exposure to AI technologies influence their perceptions of SM, an interactive, AI-based formative assessment tool. Drawing on Self-Determination Theory and user experience research, we examine how AI literacy, perceived usability, and satisfaction relate to student engagement and perceived learning effectiveness. Data were collected from 309 undergraduates in Computer Science and Business courses using validated surveys. Partial least squares structural equation modeling revealed that AI literacy - particularly self-efficacy, conceptual understanding, and application skills - significantly predicts usability, satisfaction, and engagement. Usability and satisfaction, in turn, strongly predict perceived learning effectiveness. Prior AI exposure showed no significant effect. By clarifying the mechanisms through which AI literacy influences learning outcomes via usability and satisfaction, this study provides empirical evidence from a large, diverse undergraduate sample and offers actionable design recommendations for creating inclusive, motivating, and effective AI learning environments that account for varying literacy levels.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,include,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08549,Standard patient training versus Vik-Asthme chatbot-guided training: 'AsthmaTrain' - a protocol for a randomised controlled trial for patients with asthma,"Introduction Therapeutic education for patients with asthma has been shown to reduce asthma morbidity. The high availability of smart phones provides the opportunity to furnish patient training via specifically designed chatbot applications. The goal of this protocol is to perform a first pilot comparison of traditional face to face versus chatbot-guided patient therapeutic education programmes for patients with asthma.Methods and analysis Eighty adult patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of asthma will be enrolled in a two-parallel-arm, randomised (1:1) controlled pilot trial. A single-Zelen consent procedure is deployed to first enrol all participants in the comparator arm, that is, the standard patient therapeutic education programme at the University Hospitals of Montpellier, France. This means of patient therapeutic education is based on reoccurring interviews and discussion with qualified nursing staff as per usual care. Following baseline data acquisition, randomisation will be performed. Those patients randomised to the comparator arm will not be informed of the second arm. Those patients randomised to the experimental arm will be proposed access to a specifically designed chatbot (Vik-Asthme) as the second tested means of patient training (refusals continue with standard training, though analysed as intention to treat). The primary outcome is change in the total Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire score at the end of follow-up (6 months). Secondary outcomes cover asthma control, spirometry, general health status, programme adherence and burden for medical staff, exacerbations and medical resource use (medications, consults, emergency visits, hospitalisation and intensive care).Ethics and dissemination This study ('AsthmaTrain' protocol version 4-20220330) has been approved by the Committee for the Protection of Persons Ile-de-France VII on 28 March 2022 (reference number 21.03617.000059).

REC_02738,"Factors influencing pre-service special education teachers' intention toward AI in education: Digital literacy, teacher self-efficacy, perceived ease of use, and perceived usefulness","The use of artificial intelligence in education (AIEd) has become increasingly significant globally. In China, there is a lack of research examining the behavioral intention toward AIEd among preservice special education (SPED) teachers in terms of digital literacy and teacher self-efficacy. Building on the technology acceptance model, our study evaluated the aspects influencing preservice special education teachers' intention toward AI in education. Data was gathered from 274 pre-service SPED teachers studying at a Chinese public normal university of special education and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results show that digital literacy is associated with the perceived usefulness and ease of use of AIEd, which influences SPED teachers' intention to use AIEd. Additionally, digital literacy significantly impacts the self-efficacy of SPED teachers. Given these results, AI designers in special education should comprehend the effectiveness and usability of AIEd for fostering behavioral intention formation. Simultaneously, special educational programs that identify key content and activities for digital literacy training should be developed, and educators should attempt to execute the relevant pre-service training to enhance the intention of pre-service SPED teachers toward AIEd.",2024,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_04901,Intent mining framework for understanding online conversations on vaping to inform social media-based intervention design,"The recent surge in the usage of e-cigarettes amongst youth has highlighted a long-standing societal crisis. To assist public health agencies in policymaking, past research often employed traditional survey-based methods to understand youth behavior, which suffer from response biases and scalability, are time-consuming, and their findings often lag the fast-changing public behavior. Our study fills this gap by using social media as a complementary data source to understand user intentions for vape usage at a large scale, thus, providing an alternative to traditional survey-based methods. In this paper, we propose a novel user intent mining framework under the guidance of social cognitive theory for health behavioral interventions that helps study user intentions across different social media platforms. We then employ this framework to investigate the feasibility of automated intent mining on social media by formulating a multi-class classification task, employing machine learning algorithms to classify a social media message across relevant intent classes: Accusational, Anecdotal, Informational, Justificational and Promotional. The analyses indicate that Accusational tweets and Anecdotal messages were most prevalent on X/Twitter and Reddit respectively. We further provide novel insights on the conversational context using topic modeling analysis and psychometric analysis consequently, informing intervention designs and assisting health analysts.

REC_08559,Social media and postsecondary student adoption of mental health labels: Protocol for a scoping review,"Introduction Many postsecondary students use social media at an age when mental health issues often arise for the first time. On social media, students describe their mental states or social interactions using psychiatric language. This is a process of mental health labelling as opposed to receiving a formal diagnosis from a psychiatrist. Despite substantial literature on psychiatric labelling effects such as stigma, little research has addressed the mechanisms and effects of labelling through social media. Our objective is to summarise the existing evidence to address this gap. Methods and analysis This review includes articles in English published since 1995 on how postsecondary students interact with mental health labels in their use of social media. We will consider empirical studies and theses. The search strategy includes SCOPUS, PubMed, OVID MEDLINE (to access APA PsycINFO), Web of Science and ProQuest Global Dissertations and Theses. This scoping review follows the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extensions for protocols and Scoping Reviews guidelines. The artificial intelligence application, Connected Papers, will assist in identifying additional references. The outcomes of interest are labelling by self or others and changes in self-concept and presentation associated with these labels. Two researchers will independently identify the included studies and extract data, solving disagreements with a third opinion. We will produce tables and narrative descriptions of the operationalisation and measurement methods of labelling and social media use, reported effects and uses of labelling, and explanatory mechanisms for the adoption of labels. Ethics and dissemination This literature review does not require ethics approval. The researchers will present their findings for publication in an open-access peer-reviewed journal and at student/scientific conferences. Potential knowledge users include university students, social media users, researchers, mental health professionals and on-campus mental health services. © Author(s) (or their employer(s)) 2024.

Design/methodology/approach The proposed model for this study adopted a unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as a base model and incorporated the following constructs: availability of resources (AR), computer self-efficacy (CSE), perceived enjoyment (PE) and continuance intention to use (CIU). The study used an online questionnaire to collect data from 280 students of a Technical University in Ghana. The partial least square-structural equation model (PLS-SEM) method was used to determine the measurement model's reliability and validity. Machine learning algorithms were used to determine the relationships among the constructs in the proposed research model. Findings The findings from the study confirmed that AR, CSE, PE, performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence predicted students' continuance intention to use the LMS. In addition, CIU and facilitating conditions predicted the continuance use of the LMS. Originality/value The use of machine learning algorithms in e-learning systems literature has been rarely used. Thus, this study contributes to the literature on the continuance use of e-learning systems using machine learning algorithms.

REC_05514,Mechanisms of academic stress affecting AI-assisted cheating behaviour in college students: a mixed methods study,"The emergence of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has provided college students with tools to mitigate academic stress but has also facilitated AI-assisted cheating. However, existing research offers limited insight into how academic stress influences cheating behaviours and the underlying psychological mechanisms, leaving a significant gap in understanding. This study aims to develop and validate a theoretical model explaining how academic stress influences college students' intentions to engage in AI-assisted cheating. Grounded in the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB), this research employed a mixed-methods approach. Quantitative data were analysed to explore relationships among academic stress, academic self-efficacy, attitudes toward AI-assisted cheating, and cheating intentions. A survey analyzed 458 valid questionnaires from students, while follow-up qualitative interviews with 21 students who admitted to using AI to assist in cheating provided in-depth analysis. Findings indicate that academic stress directly influences students' AI-assisted cheating intentions and indirectly does so through academic self-efficacy and attitudes as mediators. Qualitative interviews reinforced these findings by offering contextual explanations. This study reveals both direct and indirect pathways linking academic stress to AI-assisted cheating, contributing to a deeper theoretical and practical understanding of academic misconduct in the GAI era.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,include,0.0,0.95,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Using the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) model as the primary theoretical lens, this study incorporated personal innovativeness as both a dependent and moderating variable to understand students' ChatGPT use behaviour.Design/methodology/approachThis quantitative study used a questionnaire survey to collect data. A total of 500 legitimate undergraduates from 17 government universities in Sri Lanka were selected for this study. Items for the variables were adopted from previously validated instruments. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 4 was used to investigate latent constructs' relationships. Furthermore, the variables' relative relevance was ranked using a two-stage artificial neural network analysis with the SPSS 27 application.FindingsThe results of the analysis revealed that eight of the nine proposed hypotheses were confirmed. The most significant determinants of behavioural intention were habit and performance expectancy, closely followed by hedonic motivation and perceived ease of use. Use behaviour was highly influenced by both behavioural intention and personal inventiveness. Though personal innovativeness (PI) was suggested as a moderator, the relationship was not significant.Research limitations/implicationsThe research highlights the impact of habit, performance expectancy and perceived ease of use on students' acceptance of AI applications such as ChatGPT, emphasising the need for efficient implementation techniques, individual variations in technology adoption and continuous support and training to improve students' proficiency.Originality/valueThis study enhances the comprehension of how undergraduate students adopt ChatGPT in an educational setting.

This study contextualises the key elements from deterrence and neutralisation theories, including the role of gender, which influence the students' misuse intention in higher education towards using GenAI to assist in completing their academic work. We collected data from 413 business school students in India who had already used ChatGPT for their academic assignments. The analysis indicates a positive relationship between all neutralisation techniques and misuse intention. Regarding deterrence elements, the severity of formal sanctions, the certainty of shame, and moral beliefs negatively affect the students' misuse intention. In terms of the moderating influence of gender, we found that male students, as compared to females, are relatively likely to exhibit a greater degree of neutralisation behaviour and a lesser degree of deterrence behaviour. Overall, the results show that neutralisation techniques have a greater impact than deterrence factors in controlling the misuse of GenAI for academic assignments. The study further reflects how the impact of neutralisation constructs and deterrence factors varies between males and females in using GenAI at higher education institutions.",2025,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming education through adaptive learning systems, intelligent tutoring, and personalized instruction. Although AI has become increasingly prominent in language education, its specific impact on enhancing Arabic proficiency has not been adequately explored, especially in terms of student engagement, linguistic development, and sustained adoption. This study examines the behavioral factors influencing the use of Generative AI (GenAI) in Arabic language learning by applying the Extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) framework. Materials/methods. To achieve this, quantitative data were collected from students at Sultan Qaboos University in Oman, including both Arabic majors and students from other disciplines. This study utilizes ordinal logistic regression to examine the key factors influencing students' adoption of AI in Arabic language learning. It explores how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, hedonic motivation, and habit shape students’ engagement with AI-driven tools. Results. Findings indicate that performance expectancy and social influence are the strongest drivers of adoption, while effort expectancy and facilitating conditions play a key role in sustained engagement. Despite AI’s potential to enhance pronunciation, grammar, and vocabulary acquisition, adoption remains inconsistent due to usability issues, content accuracy concerns, and varying levels of AI literacy.

REC_14107,Ethical Use of Generative Artificial Intelligence Among Ecuadorian University Students,"Artificial intelligence has transformed educational environments by facilitating processes such as information retrieval, assisted writing, automated feedback, and personalized tutoring. Within university settings, the adoption of technologies capable of autonomously generating content has increased rapidly, becoming a common academic resource for students. However, this accelerated integration poses ethical challenges, particularly when such tools are used without a clear understanding of their implications. This study aimed to examine how students' emotional attitudes (affective), understanding (cognitive), and practical use (behavioral) of AI relate to their ethical engagement with these technologies. A structured questionnaire was administered to 833 university students in Ecuador. The instrument showed excellent internal consistency (alpha = 0.992; Omega = 0.992), and the validity analyses confirmed that the dimensions measured distinct but related constructs. ChatGPT was reported as the most used tool (62.2%), followed by Gemini and Siri. The structural model indicated that emotional and cognitive dimensions substantially influenced ethical behavior (beta = 0.413 and beta = 0.567, respectively), whereas frequent use alone exhibited no significant effect (beta = -0.128; p = 0.058). These results suggest that ethical engagement with AI is primarily driven by reflection and knowledge rather than habit. This study contributes to the literature by modeling how different learning dimensions shape ethical behavior in AI use and underscores the relevance of aligning academic practices with socially responsible uses of emerging technologies.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14108,AI Literacy in Achieving Sustainable Development Goals: The Interplay of Student Engagement and Anxiety Reduction in Northern Cyprus Universities,"Technological development in artificial intelligence (AI) has significantly transformed the learning context, and university-level students are now required to possess AI literacy. Effective research, however, has not been conducted to study factors influencing AI literacy. Grounded in engagement theory, self-efficacy theory, and transactional distance theory, this research investigates how anxiety, self-efficacy, and AI literacy are associated among Northern Cyprus University students. A cross-sectional survey was conducted, gathering data from 222 participating students from different universities in the region. Findings indicate that for university students in Northern Cyprus, student engagement significantly influences AI literacy. Also, the relationship between student engagement and AI literacy is mediated by anxiety reduction, which denotes that higher engagement decreases anxiety, enhancing AI literacy. Moreover, it is found that self-efficacy mediates the relationship between student engagement and AI literacy, which indicates that higher levels of engagement result in higher levels of self-efficacy, resulting in higher levels of AI literacy outcomes. Smart PLS 4 structural equation modeling (SEM) was used in data analysis and gaining meaningful insight into these relationships. The study contributes to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 3 and 4 through the facilitation of mental well-being and inclusive quality education via improved AI competencies, proposing evidence-based perceptions into how engagement, anxiety reduction, and self-efficacy boost well-being and education. The findings of the study will enable educators, policymakers, and curriculum developers to design curricula and educational strategies that reduce anxiety, strengthen the self-efficacy of learners, and thereby strengthen their AI literacy level.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,exclude,0.0,0.95,,E4,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05525,Using machine learning methods to identify trajectories of change and predict responders and non-responders to short-term dynamic therapy,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 35(7) of Psychotherapy Research (see record 2026-57088-001). In the original article, there were some incorrect figures. The corrected figures are given in the erratum.] Objectives: Predicting therapy responders can significantly improve clinical outcomes. This study aims to identify predictors of response to short-term dynamic therapy. Methods: Data from 95 patients who underwent 16-session therapy were analyzed using machine learning. Weekly progress was monitored with the Outcome Questionnaire (OQ45) and Target Complaints (TC). A machine learning model identified change trajectories for responders and non-responders, with a random forest algorithm and elastic net modeling predicting trajectory group membership using pre-treatment data. Results: A weak positive relationship was found between the trajectories of the two outcome variables. The results of the different analysis methods were compared and discussed. Important predictors of OQ45 trajectories, based on random forest modeling, included initial symptom severity, difficulties in emotion regulation, coldness, avoidant attachment, conscientiousness, interpersonal problems, non-acceptance of negative emotion, neuroticism, emotional clarity, impulsivity, and emotion awareness (72.8% accuracy). Initial problem severity, self-scarifying extraversion, and non-assertiveness were the most dominant predictors for TC trajectories (62.8% accuracy). Conclusions: These findings offer data-driven insights for selecting short-term dynamic therapy. Predicting response for the OQ45, a nomothetic measure, does not extend to the TC, an idiographic measure, and vice versa, highlighting the importance of multidimensional outcome evaluations for personalized treatment.

REC_12092,Between Documentation and Pedagogy: ESL/EFL Teacher Burnout and Perceptions of AI's Potential for Workload Relief,"Background/purpose. ESL/EFL teachers face unique burnout challenges due to quality assurance (QA) requirements, increasing class sizes, and intensive feedback demands. This research investigates how these factors contribute to teacher burnout in Saudi higher education and explores the potential of AI as a workload solution. Grounded in the Job Demands-Resources model and Technology Acceptance Model, the study examines burnout drivers, feedback practices, class size effects, AI perceptions, and demographic variation. Materials/methods. This mixed-methods study collected quantitative data from 258 ESL/EFL teachers and qualitative insights from 15 interviews and 5 focus groups. Analysis employed structural equation modeling, LASSO regression, and mediation analysis to examine burnout mechanisms and potential technological interventions. Results. Findings reveal that QA standards significantly increase workload while reducing teachers' ability to provide individualized feedback, with workload acting as a powerful mediator of teacher wellbeing. While educators recognize AI's potential to support administrative tasks, significant adoption gaps persist—particularly among highly qualified and experienced staff who express concerns about professional identity and pedagogical displacement. Conclusion. This study uniquely frames AI as a classroom assistant rather than a replacement for pedagogical judgment, offering empirical evidence that teacher-centered AI integration could alleviate workload stress while preserving professional autonomy. Recommendations include recalibrating QA implementation and developing AI systems that complement rather than replace teacher expertise in ESL/EFL contexts.https://doi.org/10.22521/edupij.2025.17.309 © The Author(s), 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14110,Sustainable AI Solutions for Empowering Visually Impaired Students: The Role of Assistive Technologies in Academic Success,"This paper examines the impacts of AI-powered assistive technologies (AIATs) on the academic success of higher education university students with visual impairments. As digital learning contexts become progressively more prevalent in higher education institutions, it is critical to understand how these technologies foster the academic success of university students with blindness or low vision. Based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, the study conducted a quantitative research approach and collected data from 390 visually impaired students who were enrolled in different universities across Saudi Arabia (SA). Employing Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM), the paper tested the influences of four UTAUT dimensions-Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Conditions (FC)-on Academic Performance (AP), while also evaluating the mediating role of Behavioral Intention (BI). The results revealed a significant positive relationship between the implementation of AI-based assistive tools and students' academic success. Particularly, BI emerged as a key mediator in these intersections. The results indicated that PE (beta = 0.137, R2 = 0.745), SI (beta = 0.070, R2 = 0.745), and BI (beta = 0.792, R2 = 0.745) significantly affected AP. In contrast, EE (beta = -0.041, R2 = 0.745) and FC (beta = -0.004, R2 = 0.745) did not have a significant effect on AP. Concerning predictors of BI, PE (beta = 0.412, R2 = 0.317), SI (beta = 0.462, R2 = 0.317), and EE (beta = 0.139, R2 = 0.317) were all positively associated with BI. However, FC had a significant negative association with BI (beta = -0.194, R2 = 0.317). Additionally, the analysis revealed that EE, SI, and PE can all indirectly enhance Academic Performance by influencing BI. The findings provide practical insights for higher education policymakers, higher education administrators, and AI designers, emphasizing the need to improve the accessibility and usability of sustainable and long-term assistive technologies to better accommodate learners with visual impairments in higher education contexts.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.95,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08625,When Biased Humans Meet Debiased AI: A Case Study in College Major Recommendation,"Currently, there is a surge of interest in fair Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) research which aims to mitigate discriminatory bias in AI algorithms, e.g., along lines of gender, age, and race. While most research in this domain focuses on developing fair AI algorithms, in this work, we examine the challenges which arise when humans and fair AI interact. Our results show that due to an apparent conflict between human preferences and fairness, a fair AI algorithm on its own may be insufficient to achieve its intended results in the real world. Using college major recommendation as a case study, we build a fair AI recommender by employing gender debiasing machine learning techniques. Our offline evaluation showed that the debiased recommender makes fairer career recommendations without sacrificing its accuracy in prediction. Nevertheless, an online user study of more than 200 college students revealed that participants on average prefer the original biased system over the debiased system. Specifically, we found that perceived gender disparity is a determining factor for the acceptance of a recommendation. In other words, we cannot fully address the gender bias issue in AI recommendations without addressing the gender bias in humans. We conducted a follow-up survey to gain additional insights into the effectiveness of various design options that can help participants to overcome their own biases.

REC_07079,E-learning in higher education during COVID-19: evidence from blackboard learning system,"Purpose - The blackboard learning system is an online platform designed for e-learning employed by higher education institutes like universities that facilities students to continue learning and educational activities. This study explores the determinants that affect students' acceptance and use of Blackboard learning system (BLS) in Pakistan utilizing the modified UTAUT framework with social isolation as an additional variable. Design/methodology/approach - A questionnaire survey was conducted, and the study gathered 494 university students' responses in Pakistan as participants. The collected data were interpreted applying PLS-SEM version 3.2.3 software. Findings - The study's findings exhibited that PE, EE, FC and SI are the prime determinants influencing the intention and use of BLS in Pakistani universities. Hedonic motivation and social isolation interact differently between UTAUT variables and use intention. The results verify the suitability of the applied theory in the background of the study. Research limitations/implications - However, the findings highlight the present understanding of BLS use from the learners' aspect, but the study's limitation cannot be evaded. The study respondents belonged to a specific region of Pakistan (Karachi) that might influence the usefulness of the outcomes. Other factors categorized as the environmental, system and organizational elements were not part of the study that may also differentiate the BLS acceptance. The model was extended by including the social isolation, but the effect is insignificant yet positive; therefore, it is required to evaluate the model differently, such as the organizational aspect, for future research. Moreover, the ethnic factors that vary in emerging and developed economies may provide different explanations; therefore, they can be incorporated in future studies. Likewise, the variables such as hedonic motivation need to be emphasized more by examining and evaluating its effect on students' education performance in the future. Practical implications - The outcome of the study suggests some implications. At first, being the modified framework UTAUT2 application makes the collaboration appropriate according to the current phenomena of the COVID-19 pandemic and its contribution to the higher education region to analyze the acceptance of e-learning systems. Educational institutions within Pakistan would emphasize enhancing students' accomplishment by improving the interface and the blackboard learning system workability. Hence, learners' effectiveness in learning would be escalated; they would be encouraged to accomplish study objectives using BLS, particularly when they consider it easy to use and a useful platform for e-learning during the pandemic. Furthermore, enhancing the e-learning system in the context of the effort demands to be required to utilize BLS should be the foremost objective as learners would be motivated to accept the technology if they consider it simple, convenient, and user-friendly to adopt. Thus, the benefits of using BLS during this situation when universities are not operational will make students adaptable to change in the prospect. Learners will accept the model of online education, even if the universities become operational. However, it can increase the rate of earnings and revenue for universities as they can enroll in online and regular classes. Therefore, it is suggested that higher education management should create a resilient online platform by which facilitators can communicate with learners without any obstacles. Social implications - Hence, it is recommended to introduce the online short course, qualification, certified courses and integrated coursework with international ventures and ongoing classes. Numerous learners continue their studies along with the job. Therefore, it is suggested to introduce online programs for those learners. Another benefit would be that it offers an integrated platform for sharing knowledge. BLS offers to maintain the complete information in one place, and learners can see them as per their convenience based on their availability. This reduces the burden on administration related to keeping the educational material and resource in various files. Thus, it also reduces the expense of universities. It is suggested to emphasize encouraging the use of BLS through an effective plan that can assist in execution and help learners identify the technology features rather than to face difficultly to accept the change. Moreover, the acceptance of BLS for educational purposes verifies that other learning events can occur on the online platform. Thus, it is recommended to promote the origin of the online atmosphere and the initiation of other events. Globally, dynamics are changing frequently and continuously and are moving towards artificial intelligence systems; the circumstances are suitable for promoting online educational platforms' acceptance by incorporating it with the current educational arrangement. Originality/value - The study provides recommendations for the research to be conducted to explore the modified framework in different regions and boundaries to evaluate the effect of other factors on adopting e-learning platforms.",2022,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E2,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13199,Influence of deep learning-based journal reading guidance system on students' national cognition and cultural acceptance,"The purpose is to explore new cultivation modes of college students' national cognition and cultural acceptance. Deep learning (DL) technology and Educational Psychology theory are introduced, and the influence of art journal reading on college students' national cognition and cultural acceptance is analyzed under Educational Psychology. Firstly, the background of Educational Psychology, national cognition and cultural acceptance, and learning system are discussed following a literature review. The DL technology is introduced to construct the journal reading guidance system. The system can provide users with art journals and record the user habits like reading duration and preferences. Secondly, hypotheses are proposed, and a questionnaire survey is designed, with 12 specific indicators to investigate and collect research data. Finally, the collected data are analyzed. The results show that women's cognition of Chinese traditional culture, Chinese excellent revolutionary culture, and Chinese national identity is higher than that of men. By comparison, men's cognition of Chinese advanced socialist culture is higher than women's. After using the journal reading guidance system, the cognition of female college students on traditional Chinese culture is improved by 16.3%. Before and after reading art journals, the overall national cognition and cultural acceptance of Minority students are higher than that of Han students. The overall cognition of Literature and History students is higher than that of Science and Engineering students in traditional Chinese culture and China's excellent revolutionary culture and lower in advanced Chinese socialist culture and Chinese national identity. The overall cognition of college students' party members to the advanced socialist culture is higher than league members. As students read more art journals through the guidance system, their overall national cognition and cultural acceptance have increased. Therefore, reading art journals can promote college students' national cognition and cultural acceptance. A national cognition and cultural acceptance promotion system that conforms to the current situation of college students is constructed. The finding provides a reference for developing complex emotion recognition technology in human-computer interaction.",2022,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,exclude,0.0,0.9,,E4,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14111,Understanding Continuance Intention of Generative AI in Education: An ECM-Based Study for Sustainable Learning Engagement,"Rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the emergence of generative AI models like generative AI that produce human-like responses and support a wide range of applications. This study explores the key factors influencing the continuance intention of generative AI among university students, drawing on established theoretical frameworks including the expectancy confirmation model and technology acceptance model. Using data collected from 282 users, structural equation modeling was applied to examine relationships among knowledge application, perceived intelligence, perceived usefulness, confirmation, satisfaction, AI configuration, social influence, and continuance intention. The results show that both knowledge application and perceived intelligence significantly influence perceived usefulness and confirmation. Perceived usefulness was found to positively affect both satisfaction and continuance intention, while confirmation strongly influenced both perceived usefulness and satisfaction. Satisfaction emerged as a key predictor of continuance intention, as did social influence. However, AI configuration did not significantly impact continuance intention. The model explained 64.1% of the variance in continuance intention. These findings offer meaningful insights for improving the design, implementation, and promotion of AI-based language tools in educational settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.95,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02766,A two-staged SEM-ANN approach to predict learning presence in online foreign language education: The role of teaching presence and online interaction,"While the theoretical value of the Community of Inquiry (CoI) framework in comprehending online learning experiences has been acknowledged, the newly introduced CoI element—learning presence—has received insufficient attention in the field of foreign language (FL) education. Drawing on the constructivist stimulus-mediation-response approach, this study investigated the predicting effects of teaching presence and online interaction on learning presence. Data were collected from 460 college-level online Chinese as a Foreign Language (CFL) learners at seven Chinese higher education institutions. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to explore the linear relationships, followed by the artificial neural network (ANN) technique to assess the relative importance of predictors based on the nonlinear relationships between variables in the research model. The results support most of the predictive effects of teaching presence and online interaction on learning presence variables (self-efficacy, metacognitive self-regulation, and metacognitive co-regulation). Teaching presence, learner-instructor interaction, and learner-learner interaction were the most influential predictors of self-efficacy, metacognitive self-regulation, and metacognitive co-regulation, respectively. Furthermore, the mediating role of online interaction between teaching presence and learning presence was partially supported. The findings highlight the critical roles of teaching presence and online interaction in fostering online FL learners' active and responsible learning while offering valuable insights into the design of online language courses. © 2025 Elsevier Inc.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E2,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_04986,Beliefs affecting concussion reporting among military cadets: Advanced observations through machine learning,"Background: Untreated concussions are an important health concern. The number of concussions sustained each year is difficult to pinpoint due to diverse reporting routes and many people not reporting. A growing body of literature investigates the motivations for concussion under-reporting, proposing ties with knowledge of concussion outcomes and concussion culture. The present work employs machine learning to identify trends in knowledge and willingness to self-report concussions. Methods: 2,204 cadets completed a survey addressing athletic and pilot status, concussion symptoms and outcome beliefs, ethical beliefs, demographics, and reporting willingness. Results: Clustering and non-negative matrix analysis identified connections to self-report willingness within: knowledge of symptoms, ethical beliefs, reporting requirements, and belief of long-term concussion outcomes. Support vector machine classification of cadet reporting likelihood reveals symptom and outcome knowledge may be inversely related to reporting among those rating ethics considerations as low, while heightened ethics may predict higher reporting likeliness overall. Conclusions: Machine-learning analysis bolsters prior theories on the importance of concussion culture in reporting and indicate more symptom knowledge may decrease willingness to report. Uniquely, our analysis indicated importance of ethical behavior may be associated with general concussion reporting willingness, inviting further consideration from healthcare practitioners seeking increased reporting.

Participants reviewed scores and feedback provided by either AI or a human and completed a survey measuring their perceptions before and after disclosure of the source. Analyses revealed that students often struggled to accurately identify the evaluator. Additionally, while perceptions of AI scoring and feedback were generally moderate, exposure to AI significantly reduced students' confidence in AI scoring. The source of the grading and identification accuracy significantly influenced students' perceptions. Human grading was associated with more positive perceptions, while incorrect identification-when not combined with human grading-also led to more positive perceptions. However, the interaction of human grading and incorrect identification resulted in more negative perceptions.

REC_02771,Can theory-driven learning analytics dashboard enhance human-AI collaboration in writing learning? Insights from an empirical experiment,"The integration of Generative AI (GenAI) into education has raised concerns about over-reliance and superficial learning, particularly in writing tasks in higher education. This study explores whether a theory-driven learning analytics dashboard (LAD) can enhance human-AI collaboration in the academic writing task by improving writing knowledge gains, fostering self-regulated learning (SRL) skills and shaping different human-AI dialogue characteristics. Grounded in Zimmerman's SRL framework, the LAD provided real-time feedback on learners' goal-setting, writing processes and reflection, while monitoring the quality of learner-AI interactions. A quasiexperiment was conducted involving 52 postgraduate students in a human-AI collaborative writing task. The students were divided into an experimental group (EG) that used the LAD and a control group (CG) that did not. Pre- and post- knowledge tests, questionnaires measuring SRL and cognitive load, and students' dialogue data with GenAI were collected and analyzed. Results showed that the EG achieved significantly higher writing knowledge gains and improved SRL skills, particularly in self-efficacy and cognitive strategies. However, the EG also reported increased test anxiety and cognitive load, possibly due to heightened metacognitive awareness. Epistemic Network Analysis revealed that the EG engaged in more reflective, evaluative interactions with GenAI, while the CG focused on more transactional and information-seeking exchanges. These findings contribute to the growing body of literature on the educational use of GenAI and highlight the importance of designing interventions that complement GenAI tools, ensuring that technology enhances rather than undermines the learning process.",2026,WoS,uncertain,exclude,0.0,0.95,,E7,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Perceived usefulness also scored highly, recognizing ChatGPT’s potential to enhance their academic performance. However, satisfaction levels were notably lower, due to dissatisfaction with subscription fees, which became a barrier to complete user acceptance. Perceived usefulness positively correlated with satisfaction and moderately with continuance intention. Ease of use showed inverse correlations with both.

This study examines how demographic characteristics, usage patterns, perceived GAI literacy, and ethical awareness relate to Chinese undergraduates' attitudes toward GAI in academic contexts. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 895 university students from diverse majors. Participants completed a validated GAI Attitude Scale alongside demographic and experiential measures. Descriptive statistics and multiple linear regression analyses were employed to explore how demographic, experiential, and ethical factors relate to students' attitudes toward GAI. The findings indicate that female students perceived GAI as more useful than male students, while no significant differences were observed across grade levels. Students from non-humanities majors reported more positive attitudes than those in humanities. Regression results further showed that GAI usage frequency and ethical awareness were the strongest predictors of positive attitudes, while demographic factors such as year of study and major became non-significant once other variables were considered. The final model explained 26 % of the variance in overall attitudes. These results suggest that students' acceptance of GAI is shaped less by demographic background than by their engagement with and ethical awareness of the technology.

This study employs a cross-sectional quantitative design to examine the relationships between SDL, AL, and CT in the context of adult learners' use of GenAI tools like ChatGPT. It considers how demographic variables moderate these relationships. The study was underpinned by the SDL theory by Tough in 1971. An analysis of 281 survey responses of adult learners grouped by generation from five (5) adult higher education institutions in Ghana was performed using descriptive statistics, ANOVA (analysis of variance), and SEM (structural equation modeling). The study's findings indicate that GenAI is perceived as having a significant positive effect on the SDL, AL, and CT of adult learners. A significant positive interrelationship was observed between SDL, AL, and CT. Demographic factors involving gender, year born (generational group), education level, and mode of learning had a perceived significant positive effect on SDL, AL, and CT. Notably, no statistical mean differences were found in the use of GenAI for SDL, AL, and CT across generational groups. The findings advocate for the effective adoption of GenAI to foster lifelong learning among adult learners. Developers of learning technologies and higher education leaders should ensure an inclusive GenAI design.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.95,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12126,The Hidden Sexual Minorities: Machine Learning Approaches to Estimate the Sexual Minority Orientation Among Beijing College Students,"Based on the fourth-wave Beijing College Students Panel Survey (BCSPS), this study aims to provide accurate estimation of the percentage of the potential sexual minorities among the Beijing college students by using machine learning methods. Specifically, we employ random forest (RF), an ensemble learning approach for classification and regression, to predict the sexual orientation of those who were not willing to disclose his/her inherent sexual identity. To overcome the imbalance problem arising from far different numerical proportion of sexual minority and majority members, we adopt the repeated random sub-sampling for training set by partitioning those who expressed heterosexual orientation into different number of splits and further combining each split with those who expressed sexual minority orientation. The prediction from 24-split random forest suggests that youths in Beijing with sexual minority orientation amount to 5.71%, almost two times that of the original estimation 3.03%. The results are robust to alternative learning methods and covariate sets. Besides, it is also suggested that random forest outperforms other learning algorithms, including AdaBoost, Naive Bayes, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression, in dealing with missing data, by showing higher accuracy, F1 score, and area under curve (AUC) value.",2022,IEEE,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E4,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08685,Application of Artificial Neural Networks to Predict the Use of Mobile Learning by University Students,"The use of mobile devices has become pervasive in recent times, constituting an essential component of daily life. Mobile phones have enabled certain minorities to attain access to the Internet, news, and knowledge, thereby indicating their potential to reduce the digital divide experienced by ethnic groups and those from low socioeconomic backgrounds. This phenomenon has generated academic interest in the utilization of mobile devices to facilitate learning, as these devices merge the lines between computing and communications, giving access to both. The objective of this study is to ascertain the inclination of Peruvian higher education students to use mobile devices for learning. This will be achieved through the use of an anticipated model based on artificial neural networks (ANNs). ANNs are supervised machine learning techniques that imitate the organization and operation of the human brain to process data and render decisions. ANNs are computer systems that can learn from observation and experience, much like the human brain, and can subsequently use the acquired knowledge to recognize patterns and make predictions. The objective of this study is to assess the intention of Peruvian tertiary education students to employ mobile devices for learning by creating a predictive model that relies on ANNs. Among the main findings, it is evident that the ANN with optimal performance has 10 neurons within its hidden layer. Factors such as experience with virtual subjects, frequency of use, and coverage are crucial for the two intention variables.

REC_02868,"Deskilling, reskilling, or upskilling? Unpacking the pathways of student adaptation to generative artificial intelligence","The proliferation of generative AI (GAI) like ChatGPT is transforming how students engage with information and knowledge-focused activities in higher education, sparking debate about its dual impact on learning. While GAI offers potential benefits like enhanced efficiency, concerns about risks such as skill erosion persist. To address this tension, we investigate how students' dependence on GAI shapes their learning outcomes through skill adaptation processes and under what conditions these effects occur. We conducted a three-phase mixed-methods study (survey N = 306; interviews N =16; experiment N = 397). Our findings reveal that GAI dependence, influenced by individual learning goals (performance-avoidance/-approach), drives three distinct skill adaptation processes: deskilling (skill erosion), reskilling (acquiring new GAI-related competencies), and upskilling (enhancing existing skills). These adaptations, in turn, differentially impact routine and innovative performance. Qualitative results corroborate and complement these findings, indicating that task characteristics shape GAI use patterns into substitutive and augmentative use. Finally, a scenario-based experiment provides causal evidence for this emergent insight, demonstrating how task characteristics drive the adoption of substitutive vs. augmentative use, which in turn leads to divergent skill adaptation pathways. By combining diverse methodologies, this study clarifies the lights and shadows of GAI dependence, demonstrating how its effects are contingent on individual agency, technological appropriation (substitutive vs. augmentative), and task context. Our findings advance theory on human-AI adaptation and provide practical guidance for practitioners to optimize GAI's role in learning and knowledge-focused activities.",2026,WoS,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E7,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The study employed a quantitative approach, using surveys to collect data on student attitudes toward AI across different fields of study, genders, and countries. A key innovation of this research is the development of a novel Attitude toward AI scale, designed to provide a robust and theoretically grounded instrument for measuring student perceptions of GenAI. The scale offers a valuable tool for evaluating the effectiveness of AI integration in education. The results showed that students' attitudes toward AI differed significantly based on their field of study and gender. Male students in technical sciences had the most positive attitudes toward AI adoption, indicating their potential to drive positive changes in AI implementation. While the effect size was small, this finding underscores the importance of considering individual factors when designing interventions to promote AI acceptance. The study underscored how prior experience shapes positive attitudes, highlighting the need for resources to familiarize students with GenAI and its ethics. The Attitude toward AI scale is a significant contribution addressing the lack of reliable instruments for assessing student perceptions of GenAI, enabling deeper understanding of factors influencing students' adoption, informing targeted interventions for different student groups.

This study examines the acceptance of AI as a teaching strategy among university teachers, following the extended UTAUT2 model with the inclusion of the teacher skills and knowledge for technology integration (SKTI) construct. Employing a quantitative cross-sectional research design, data were collected from 318 university teachers with prior experience using AI as a learning strategy through nonprobabilistic convenience sampling across 10 universities in northern Peru. Participants completed an online survey, and data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis tests with Dunn's post hoc comparisons, and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results showed that performance expectancy (beta = 0.129 & lowast;& lowast;), hedonic motivation (beta = 0.167 & lowast;& lowast;), habit (beta = 0.405 & lowast;& lowast;& lowast;), and SKTI (beta = 0.263 & lowast;& lowast;& lowast;) had a positive influence on the behavioral intention to adopt AI as a teaching strategy. Additionally, behavioral intention (beta = 0.303 & lowast;& lowast;& lowast;), facilitating conditions (beta = 0.115 & lowast;), and habit (beta = 0.464 & lowast;& lowast;) determine the behavioral use of AI by teachers. The Kruskal-Wallis test revealed significant differences among age groups in the performance expectancy, social influence, habit, and behavioral intention constructs, with the 37- to 48-year-old age group showing higher average ranks. The discussion highlights that these findings suggest a positive adoption of AI among teachers, driven by individual and contextual factors, and challenges assumptions about the relevance of certain constructs in this specific context.

The article is based on a thematic analysis of interviews with 16 academics from two universities and complements our study which surveyed South African students' AI usage. The findings reveal that despite the interactive potential of such AI tools to assist with student learning, the seeming 'instant perfection' of AI generated work discourages students from engaging in the difficult task of adopting academic identities. We proceed to show how usage of GenAI tools differs amongst academics based on their different understandings of the purpose of the university.",2026,WoS,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E11,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02890,Enhancing academic performance of business students using generative AI: An interactive-constructive-active-passive (ICAP) self-determination perspective,"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, have emerged as valuable assets in higher education. Despite their potential benefits in academic support, questions persist about the concrete advantages of integrating this technology into learning processes and its impact on academic outcomes. This research addresses this gap by investigating the influence of technology integration on academic performance, employing the Interactive-Constructive-Active-Passive (ICAP) framework and self-determination theory. The empirical findings from Chinese business students using Wenjuanxing platform reveal a positive impact of technology integration on business students' motivation, encompassing their learning desires, self-efficacy, and future beliefs, ultimately leading to enhanced academic performance. Notably, while epistemic curiosity augments the effects of technology integration on learning desires and future beliefs, its influence on self-efficacy is not significant. This suggests that curiosity alone might not be enough to alter deeply ingrained beliefs about one's capabilities. In conclusion, this study underscores the academic significance of these findings and their practical implications for educators and business students in optimizing ChatGPT's potential for academic success.",2024,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Nonetheless, the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI) tools appears to have relieved postgraduate students of such supposed academic stress. Despite the concerns about the potential threat of AI to academic integrity, reports have indicated that postgraduate students are developing an increasing appreciation for the use of AI-powered tools in writing. This study, therefore, sought to uncover the potential determinants of postgraduate students ' use of AI tools in academic writing. A total of 339 postgraduate students from a Ghanaian higher educational institution participated in the study. Ajzen ' s theory of planned behaviour was employed as a framework to investigate the determinants of AI use. The proposed hypotheses were all confirmed-that is, behavioural beliefs, control beliefs and normative beliefs were significant predictors of postgraduate students ' behavioural intention to use AI in academic writing. It was also revealed that postgraduate students ' behavioural intentions and their control beliefs had a significant direct effect on their actual use of AI in academic writing. The study contributes to global debates on AI in higher education by highlighting that postgraduate students ' readiness to adopt AI tools is shaped not only by individual attitudes but also by perceived academic norms and contextual constraints.

Predictors of subgroup allocation were investigated to identify the impact of psychological characteristics, stress, and socio-demographic variables on more favorable aging trajectories. Method: The sample consisted of N = 334 older adults (MAGE = 68.31 years; SD = 9.71). Clustered health trajectories were identified using a longitudinal variant of k-means and were based on health and satisfaction with life. Random forests with conditional interference were computed to examine predictive capabilities. Key predictors included psychological resilience resources, exposure to childhood adversities, and chronic stress. Data was collected via a survey, at two different time points one year apart. Results: Two different clustered health trajectories were identified: A ‘constant high health’ (low number of health-related symptoms, 65.6%) and a ‘maintaining low health’ profile (high number of symptoms, 34.4%). Over the one-year study period, both symptom profiles remained stable. Random forest analyses showed chronic stress to be the most important predictor in the interaction with other risk and also buffering factors. Conclusion: This study provides empirical evidence for two stable health trajectories in later life over one year. These results highlight the importance of chronic stress, but also psychological resilience resources in predicting aging trajectories.

Drawing on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2) and self-determination theory (SDT), this study examines the factors shaping Indonesian EFL students' intention and actual use of GenAI for English learning. Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected using an online questionnaire from 462 EFL students at three private universities in Indonesia and analyzed with the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 4. The results indicated that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, habit, autonomy, and relatedness significantly impacted EFL students' intention to adopt GenAI for English learning. While competence did not significantly influence behavioral intention, both the SDT components (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) and behavioral intention were predictors of actual usage. The integrated framework explained a high proportion of variance (R2 = 83.1% for behavioral intention; R2 = 77.1% for actual use).

REC_08699,Development and validation of artificial intelligence addiction scale for researchers: A methodological study,"Background: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools into research has brought significant advancements, enhancing efficiency, innovation, and productivity across various academic disciplines. However, alongside these transformative benefits, the growing dependence on AI tools has raised concerns regarding overreliance and the potential for addictive behaviors among researchers. Despite the widespread adoption of AI among the researchers, there remains a notable gap in the availability of validated instruments specifically designed to assess AI addiction within this context. Objective: To develop a scale to measure AI addiction among researchers and evaluate its psychometric properties. Design: A methodological design was employed, consisting of two phases: scale development and psychometric evaluation. Methods: Items were generated through a comprehensive literature review and semistructured interviews to capture AI addiction attributes. The scale’s psychometric properties—including content validity, face validity, construct validity, and internal consistency reliability—were assessed. Data from a convenience sample of 718 nursing researchers were randomly divided into two independent subsamples for exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Reliability was evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha, McDonald’s omega, split‐half reliability, and corrected item–total correlations. Results: The finalized scale comprises 22 items across five dimensions: compulsive behavior, overdependency, functional impairment, withdrawal, and tolerance. EFA identified a five‐factor structure explaining 73.66% of the variance. CFA validated the structure with robust fit indices for first order (χ²/DF = 2.289, CFI = 0.962, and RMSEA = 0.06) and second order (χ²/DF = 2.243, CFI = 0.962, and RMSEA = 0.059) models. The scale demonstrated excellent internal consistency and reliability, with Cronbach’s alpha (α = 0.924), McDonald’s omega (ω = 0.870), and a Spearman–Brown split‐half coefficient of 0.814. Moderate interfactor correlations (r = 0.41–0.62) confirmed its multidimensionality. Conclusion: The researchers’ AI addiction scale is a valid and reliable tool for assessing AI addiction among researchers, providing a robust framework to evaluate compulsive behavior, dependency, functional disruption, withdrawal symptoms, and tolerance.

Objective: The present study aimed at identifying the best predictors of the users’ level of engagement with a smartphone app for smoking cessation and at examining the relationships between predictors and outcomes related to the users’ level of engagement with the app. Methods: A secondary analysis of data from a randomized trial testing the efficacy of the Stop-Tabac smartphone app was used. The experimental group used the “full” app and the control group used a “dressed down” app. The study included a baseline and 1-month and 6-month follow-up questionnaires. A total of 5,293 participants answered at least the baseline questionnaires; however, in the current study, only the 1,861 participants who answered at least the baseline and the 1-month follow-up questionnaire were included. Predictors were measured at baseline and after 1 month and outcomes after 6 months. Data were analyzed using machine learning algorithms. Results: The best predictors of the outcomes were, in decreasing order of importance, intention to stop smoking, dependence level, perceived helpfulness of the app, having quit smoking after 1 month, self-reported usage of the app after 1 month, belonging to the experimental group (vs. control group), age, and years of smoking. Most of these predictors were also significantly associated with the participants’ level of engagement with the app. Conclusions: This information can be used to further target the app to specific groups of users, to develop strategies to enroll more smokers, and to better adapt the app’s content to the users’ needs.

The research questions are: (1) How do AI writing tools affect the linguistic features of student writing? (2) What are university instructors' attitudes toward the use of AI in writing instruction? The significance of this study arises from its addition to the literature on how AI technologies affect writing pedagogy and student learning in higher education. Using a mixed-methods design, the study questioned 60 university students enrolled in English for Academic Purposes (EAP) courses. Students were divided into two groups: students who used AI writing tools regularly and students who wrote without AI. Data were collected through essay writing tasks, student questionnaires, semi-structured interviews, and instructor feedback. Every subject wrote two essays, which were assessed for grammaticality, lexical diversity (measured in terms of the type-token ratio and vocabulary density), and coherence (based on rubric-based discourse analysis). Instructor feedback provided qualitative scores of writing depth and originality. Outcomes indicate that writing with AI significantly reduces grammatical errors, enhances vocabulary range, and promotes text cohesion by using programmed hints at linkages. However, there are serious concerns about the passive acceptance of AI suggestions by students that can compromise cognitive effort and critical thinking. There were instances when AI-produced work led to robotic sentence structure and formulaic arrangement. Teachers stressed the need for a pedagogical balance with AI tools without compromising students' ability to write independently. The report concludes that, while AI can be a good writing tool, it should never be a substitute for but only a supplement to traditional writing pedagogy.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E4,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14136,"Towards a New Conceptual Model of AI-Enhanced Learning for College Students: The Roles of Artificial Intelligence Capabilities, General Self-Efficacy, Learning Motivation, and Critical Thinking Awareness","In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, college students have faced various challenges that could negatively impact their critical thinking abilities due to disruptions to education, increased stress and anxiety, less social interaction, and the advancement of distance learning relying more heavily on digital tools. With the increasing integration of AI technology across sectors, higher education institutions have deployed various AI capabilities for intelligent campuses and modernized teaching. However, how to fully utilize AI capabilities to promote students' thinking awareness on learning effectiveness is still not clear, as critical thinking is an essential skill set holding significant implications for college students' development. This research adopts the resource-based theory (RBT) to conceptualize the university as a unified entity of artificial intelligence (AI) resources. It aims to investigate whether AI capabilities can foster critical thinking awareness among students by enhancing general self-efficacy and learning motivation. In particular, it examines the causal relationships between AI capabilities, general self-efficacy, motivation and critical thinking awareness. Primary data was collected through a questionnaire administered to 637 college students. Structural equation modeling was employed to test hypotheses pertaining to causality. The results showed that AI capabilities could indirectly enhance students' critical thinking awareness by strengthening general self-efficacy and learning motivation, but the effect on critical thinking awareness was not significant. Meanwhile, general self-efficacy significantly affected the formation of learning motivation and critical thinking awareness. This indicates that AI capabilities are able to reshape the cognitive learning process, but its direct influence on thinking awareness needs to be viewed with caution. This study explored the role of AI capabilities in education from the perspective of organizational capabilities. It not only proves how AI facilitates cognition, but also discovered the important mediating role of general self-efficacy and motivation in this process. This finding explains the inherent connections between the mechanism links. Furthermore, the study expands research on AI capabilities research from the technical level to the educational field. It provides a comprehensive and in-depth theoretical explanation theoretically, guiding the practice and application of AI in education.

Self-regulated learning enables university students to set goals, monitor their learning progress, and adjust strategies, thereby enhancing the effectiveness of GenAI-assisted learning. Guided by the three-tier model of self-regulation, which encompasses individual characteristics, cognitive and emotional factors, and behavioral intention, this study employed a mixed-method approach. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to quantitatively examine the relationships among key variables, while interviews provided qualitative insights, enabling a comprehensive exploration of factors influencing self-regulation in GenAI-assisted learning. Using a sample of 607 university students (e.g., prospective mathematics teachers) from Mainland China, this study found that compared to perceived self-efficacy and interactive learning environments, information system quality showed a stronger influence on learners perceived usefulness and satisfaction in GenAI-assisted learning. In predicting learner perceived self-regulation, perceived usefulness was a stronger predictor than the interactive learning environment and perceived satisfaction. Similarly, perceived usefulness was a stronger predictor of behavioral intention than perceived satisfaction and self-regulation. This study further investigated the partial mediating effects of perceived usefulness, perceived satisfaction, and perceived self-regulation among other variables. This study proposes a conceptual model to explore the interconnectedness of these factors in GenAI-assisted learning.

On the other hand, design-based learning (DBL) can more effectively foster creative design processes with AI technologies to overcome real-world challenges. In this context, AI-supported DBL activities have a significant potential for teaching and developing thinking skills. However, there is a lack of experimental interventions in the literature examining the effects of integrating AI into learner-centered methods on active engagement and thinking skills. The current study aims to explore the effectiveness of AI integration as a guidance and collaboration tool in a DBL process. In this context, the effect of the experimental application on the participants' design thinking mindset, creative self-efficacy (CSE), and reflective thinking (RT) self-efficacy levels and the relationship between them were examined. The participants used ChatGPT and Midjourney in the digital story development process as part of the experimental treatment. The only difference between the control and experimental groups in the digital storytelling process is the AI applications used in the experimental treatment (ChatGPT and Midjourney). In this quasi-experimental method study, participants were randomly assigned to treatment, an AI integration intervention, at the departmental level. 87 participants (undergraduate students) in the experimental group and 99 (undergraduate students) in the control group.

Using the Unified Theory of the Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and its key behaviour intention determinant, social influence, the relationship between GenAI popularity among peers and its use intention was examined. Survey data (271 UAE university students) revealed a significant relationship between social influence and GenAI use intention, with undergraduate students being more affected by peers than graduates. This difference may be explained by higher autonomy, level of independence, and less cohesive peer networks among graduate students. The increased GenAI popularity among undergraduate students can also be attributed to some degree to the non-voluntary nature of their environment and a stronger peer influence.

The consequence of this contextual and knowledge gap is a lack of specific understanding regarding students' engagement with ChatGPT for academic dishonesty in Nigerian tertiary institutions. This study addressed these gaps by examining students' perceptions, attitudes, and utilisation of the ChatGPT and determining the role of sex and age in these linkages. A sample of 4679 public university students participated in the study. Structural equation modelling and multigroup analysis were performed to test the conceptual model with the aid of SmartPLS 3. The results indicated that, regardless of sex or age, students with positive perceptions of ChatGPT were more prone to use it for dishonest academic purposes. The study noted a sex disparity in the direct impact of perception on ChatGPT use, which was particularly pronounced for female students. Significant age-related differences were observed, with a stronger effect observed for younger students. A negative direct effect of attitude on ChatGPT use for academic dishonesty was recorded, with attitude further serving as a significant negative mediator of the relationship between perception and ChatGPT use. This mediating effect was consistent across sexes but varied with age, being stronger among younger students than among their older counterparts. This study underscores the need to foster positive attitudes among younger students to counteract the appeal of using the ChatGPT for academic dishonesty.",2025,WoS,uncertain,include,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10273,A Universal Design for an Adaptive Context-Aware Mobile Cloud Learning Framework Using Machine Learning,"Mobile learning is becoming more and more popular today. It gained popularity recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in 2020. However, to provide learners with appropriate educational materials in such a mobile environment, the characteristics and context of the learners must be considered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for providing an adaptive context-aware learning process considering a combination of student learning models and principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The proposed system consists of components capable of detecting changes in context and adapting the way the application responds and behaves. The framework uses a machine-learning algorithm to predict learners' characteristics and follow UDL principles to deliver enriched user experience and location-aware content and activities. An online survey was conducted with 20 undergraduate students. We analyzed their levels of satisfaction with the proposed m-learning system. From the analyzed data, we noticed that the average rating values are close to 4.5, which indicates that the proposed m-learning system complies with UDL principles and provides an adaptive and localized learning environment, thus enhancing the efficiency of the learning process and experiences. The study also investigated the impact of factors (i.e., noise level, physical activity, and location) on learners' concentration towards the learning process. The results show that these factors have a significant impact on the learner's concentration level.",2023,IEEE,uncertain,exclude,0.0,0.9,,E8,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14141,From Perception to Practice: Artificial Intelligence as a Pathway to Enhancing Digital Literacy in Higher Education Teaching,"In the context of increasing Artificial Intelligence integration in higher education, understanding the factors influencing university teachers' adoption of AI tools is critical for effective implementation. This study adopts a perception-intention-behavior framework to explores the roles of perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, perceived trust, perceived substitution crisis, and perceived risk in shaping teachers' behavioral intention and actual usage of AI tools. It also investigates the moderating effects of peer influence and organizational support on these relationships. Using a comprehensive survey instrument, data was collected from 487 university teachers across four major regions in China. The results reveal that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are strong predictors of behavioral intention, with perceived ease of use also significantly influencing perceived usefulness. Perceived trust serves as a key mediator, enhancing the relationship between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. While perceived substitution crisis negatively influenced perceived trust, it showed no significant direct effect on behavioral intention, suggesting a complex relationship between job displacement concerns and AI adoption. In contrast, perceived risk was found to negatively impact behavioral intention, though it was mitigated by perceived ease of use. Peer influence significantly moderated the relationship between perceived trust and behavioral intention, highlighting the importance of peer influence in AI adoption, while organizational support amplified the effect of perceived ease of use on behavioral intention.

To this end, this study identified human factors in acceptance of EAITs by STM teachers in Nigeria. The study proposed an extended technology acceptance model (TAM) integrating STM teachers’ perceived trust and instructional beliefs in EAITs through a quantitative blueprint of a descriptive survey design. The sample for the study consisted of 345 STM teachers in the six education districts of Lagos State, Nigeria. A valid and reliable instrument tagged adoption of educational artificial intelligence tools questionnaire (AEAITQ, α=0.87) was used to collect survey data which, were analysed via structural equation modeling. The study results showed that STM teachers with constructivist beliefs had the tendency to adopt and incorporate EAITs into their instructional decisions than their counterparts with traditional beliefs. Traditional instructional beliefs (TIB) had a negative influence on perceived trust (PT), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and perceived usefulness (PU). In addition, PT, PEOU and PU were strong factors predicting STM teachers’ adoption of EAITs. However, PEOU was the strongest factor that predicted STM teachers’ adoption of EAITs in pedagogical discourse.

REC_13313,"Building a triadic model of technology, motivation, and engagement: a mixed-methods study of AI teaching assistants in design theory education","In design education, it is often more difficult to keep students engaged in theory courses than in hands-on studio classes. Theory courses focus on abstract concepts like design history and principles, which can feel disconnected from practical experience. This study explores how AI-powered teaching assistants can support student engagement in design theory through a mixed-methods approach. Based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Task-Technology Fit (TTF) Theory, we developed a triadic engagement model and tested it with data from 363 undergraduate design students who used a domain-specific AI assistant. Results from Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) show that communication quality, perceived competence, task-technology fit, and school support are key predictors of engagement. In contrast, individual technology fit and lecturer support have limited effects. Fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) identifies five learner profiles leading to high engagement, showing that different combinations of motivation, support, and technology fit can be effective. Interviews with 10 students identify three themes, further revealing that while the AI assistant is helpful and accessible, it lacks depth in critical thinking, and it demonstrates that students learn to verify AI assistants' responses and reflect on their learning.

Drawing on survey data from agricultural extension personnel in Tennessee, we employ regression analyses and latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) for topic modeling of open-ended responses to study the knowledge and usage of GenAI in extension. Our results show that, despite high levels of education and extensive professional experience, knowledge and usage of GenAI tools are unevenly distributed among extension personnel. In particular, ChatGPT stands out with a significantly higher recognition compared to other platforms such as Claude, Bard, Llama2, and AI Canva Image Generator, though overall usage remains modest. Regression models indicate that younger respondents and those with an undergraduate background are more likely to report familiarity with GenAI, whereas other factors, including IT training and gender, have mixed effects. LDA topic modeling of open-ended responses identifies three main themes: content creation and planning, practical resource needs, and efficiency in communication. These results suggest that while extension personnel recognize the potential of GenAI, barriers such as limited exposure and uncertainty inhibit its widespread adoption. The study concludes with policy recommendations aimed at enhancing GenAI literacy and tailoring training interventions to better support GenAI technology adoption in agricultural extension services to the benefit of farmers and agribusinesses.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,exclude,0.0,0.9,,E3,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00777,Enhancing learner affective engagement: The impact of instructor emotional expressions and vocal charisma in asynchronous video-based online learning,"In the rapidly evolving landscape of higher education and adult learning, asynchronous video-based online learning has not only become the new norm but has also emerged as the cornerstone of instructional delivery for Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs). Despite its widespread adoption, this learning mode confronts a critical challenge: the inherent lack of social presence, posing a significant risk of diminishing learner affective engagement and, consequently, jeopardizing the efficacy of learning outcomes. Addressing this pressing issue, our study conducted a comprehensive analysis of 240 instructional videos from 240 distinct instructors on a MOOC platform, supplemented by 845 post-course learner feedback surveys from a diverse cohort of college students and adult learners. Using deep learning and statistical analysis, the research revealed that the on-screen presence of instructors does not inherently affect students' affective engagement. The study revealed that learners' affective engagement is affected by distinct combinations of the instructor's facial and paraverbal expressions, including happiness, surprise, and anger, which vary depending on whether the instructor is visible. The discovery that vocal attractiveness is a pivotal element in enhancing learners' affective engagement with instructional videos marks a paradigm shift in our understanding of digital andragogy and heutagogy. This study propels academic discourse by illuminating the critical role of instructor non-verbal cues in establishing social presence and facilitating emotional contagion within asynchronous video-based online learning but also provides educators and content creators with empirically-backed techniques to revolutionize video instruction and amplify affective engagement.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E2,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10443,Predicting student satisfaction of emergency remote learning in higher education during COVID-19 using machine learning techniques,"Despite the wide adoption of emergency remote learning (ERL) in higher education during the COVID-19 pandemic, there is insufficient understanding of influencing factors predicting student satisfaction for this novel learning environment in crisis. The present study investigated important predictors in determining the satisfaction of undergraduate students (N = 425) from multiple departments in using ERL at a self-funded university in Hong Kong while Moodle and Microsoft Team are the key learning tools. By comparing the predictive accuracy between multiple regression and machine learning models before and after the use of random forest recursive feature elimination, all multiple regression, and machine learning models showed improved accuracy while the most accurate model was the elastic net regression with 65.2% explained variance. The results show only neutral (4.11 on a 7-point Likert scale) regarding the overall satisfaction score on ERL. Even majority of students are competent in technology and have no obvious issue in accessing learning devices or Wi-Fi, face-to-face learning is more preferable compared to ERL and this is found to be the most important predictor. Besides, the level of efforts made by instructors, the agreement on the appropriateness of the adjusted assessment methods, and the perception of online learning being well delivered are shown to be highly important in determining the satisfaction scores. The results suggest that the need of reviewing the quality and quantity of modified assessment accommodated for ERL and structured class delivery with the suitable amount of interactive learning according to the learning culture and program nature.",2021,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,exclude,0.0,1.0,,E2,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14424,AI-Driven Innovations in Adult EFL Learning: Exploring Potentials and Practicalities,"In a worldwide world, adults must master numerous languages, which is difficult. Recent brain research reveals that high proficiency can be attained with minimal practice, while artificial intelligence (AI) advances offer targeted and efficient language education. This study analyzes how AI techniques such as active learning, intelligent tutoring, and natural language processing can improve adult EFL acquisition. AI can improve learning, feedback, engage-ment, motivation, and outcomes compared to traditional techniques. However, interpersonal communication is crucial. The study uses instructor-learner questionnaires to emphasize the cautious acceptance of AI technologies and the need for ethical frameworks and balanced integration with human educators. This study evaluates and compares attitudes, defines the best balance between human-human and human-AI, identifies best practices for ethical risk, age matters, and adult self-determination, and guides AI integration and framework development. Adapting these technologies to decrease risk and maximize autonomy is crucial. For the following few steps, stakeholders and joint research to develop credible AI guidelines for adult EFL teaching are essential. This study examines the views of 30 EFL teachers and 35 adult learners regarding using AI to teach English. The goals are to assess expected benefits, compare attitudes, and define ethical difficulties. Questionnaires exam-ined AI impacts such as technology use, evaluation, and instigating variables. 100% of teachers expected engagement improvements. Student attitudes toward such assessment adoption were neutral, with 57% neutral on its validity. Statistical analysis using analysis of variance (ANOVA) revealed significant differences in attitudes regarding independence restriction and constraint (p < 0.05). AI augments instruction, not replaces it. Including adult learners in AI development, merging AI with traditional approaches, and using AI-augmented pedagogy to promote linguistic competency while addressing contextual and social restrictions are key recommendations. © 2025 by the authors of this article.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10467,Latent classes associated with the intention to use a symptom checker for self-triage,"It is currently unknown which attitude-based profiles are associated with symptom checker use for self-triage. We sought to identify, among university students, attitude-based latent classes (population profiles) and the association between latent classes with the future use of symptom checkers for self-triage. Informed by the Technology Acceptance Model and a larger mixed methods study, a cross-sectional survey was developed and administered to students (aged between 18 and 34 years of age) at a University in Ontario. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify attitude-based profiles that exist among the sample while general linear modeling was applied to identify the association between latent classes and future symptom checker use for self-triage. Of the 1,547 students who opened the survey link, 1,365 did not use a symptom checker in the past year and were thus identified as non-users. After removing missing data (remaining sample = n = 1,305), LCA revealed five attitude-based profiles: tech acceptors, tech rejectors, skeptics, tech seekers, and unsure acceptors. Tech acceptors and tech rejectors were the most and least prevalent classes, respectively. As compared to tech rejectors, tech seekers and unsure acceptors were the latent classes with the highest and lowest odds of future symptom checker use, respectively. After controlling for confounders, the effect of latent classes on symptom checker use remains significant (p-value < .0001) with the odds of future use in tech acceptors being 5.6 times higher than the odds of future symptom checker use in tech rejectors [CI: (3.458, 9.078); p-value < .0001]. Attitudes towards AI and symptom checker functionality result in different population profiles that have different odds of using symptom checkers for self-triage.

REC_00785,Leveraging AI-enhanced and emerging technologies for pedagogical innovations in higher education,"This study examines the influence of AI-powered and emerging technologies on pedagogical practices in higher education, focusing on their role on behavioural intention (BI) and actual usage among educators and students. The research hypothesises that the relationship between each Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) constructs - Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), and Facilitating Conditions (FC) - and BI to use AI is mediated by Attitude towards AI. Additionally, it explores the mediation of the relationship between Technological, Organisational, and Environmental (TOE) framework and BI to use AI by Attitude towards AI. Furthermore, it hypothesises that the relationship between UTAUT constructs, and the actual Usage of AI is mediated by BI. Data were collected from 115 respondents through a survey measuring perceptions of UTAUT and technology-organisation-Environment (TOE) constructs. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to analyse the data, alongside PLS-Multi-Group Analysis (PLS-MGA) to explore gender differences. The key results indicated that PE and EE significantly influenced Attitude towards AI (F = 14.861 and F = 33.887, respectively), which in turn significantly influenced BI (beta = 0.468, t = 5.106). However, SI had an insignificant effect (F = 0.346), and FC had a minimal influence (F = 2.225). The study found that Organisational Context played a significant role in shaping Attitude towards AI, influencing BI, whereas the direct influence of TOE on BI was not significant (F = 1.356), indicating full mediation by Attitude. Additionally, higher BI did not necessarily translate to increased AI usage (beta = -0.381, t = 4.749), suggesting external barriers or moderating factors.

REC_00787,Exploring the influence of ChatGPT on student academic success and career readiness,"Enhancing student academic success and career readiness is important in the rapidly evolving educational field. This study investigates the influence of ChatGPT, an AI tool, on these outcomes using the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) theory and constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The aim is to explore how ChatGPT impacts cognitive skill development, career-relevant knowledge and skills, academic success, and career readiness. Employing a quantitative research approach, survey data from 290 students at University Teknologi Malaysia were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). Findings indicate that frequent ChatGPT usage positively affects cognitive skills and career-relevant knowledge. Specifically, high-quality ChatGPT outputs significantly enhance cognitive skills (beta = 0.40, p < 0.001) and career-relevant knowledge (beta = 0.36, p < 0.001). Personalized learning experiences through ChatGPT further support cognitive development (beta = 0.23, p < 0.001) and career-relevant knowledge acquisition (beta = 0.17, p < 0.001). The study also demonstrates that improved cognitive skills contribute to higher academic success (beta = 0.35, p < 0.001) and greater career readiness (beta = 0.28, p < 0.001). However, trust in ChatGPT and access to information alone did not significantly impact cognitive skills or career-relevant knowledge. Additionally, career-relevant knowledge alone did not predict substantially career readiness, highlighting the importance of practical experience and soft skills. While ChatGPT enhances academic performance and career preparation, potential challenges include over-reliance on AI and misinformation risks. The findings highlighted the need for balanced AI integration in education, complementing traditional methods with critical evaluation skills. Future research should examine how ChatGPT can be combined with other educational strategies to improve career readiness further and address AI's limitations in educational settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,include,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_04371,"Machine creativity: Aversion, appreciation, or indifference?","Machines such as artificial intelligence (AI) and algorithms are rising in various fields. Here, we explore whether laypeople harbor an aversion to machines in art. This aversion is sometimes interpreted as a psychological defense mechanism for humans in art. We make two conceptual distinctions regarding the machine-versus-human pattern: between identity and content and between aversion, appreciation, and indifference. Their combination produces six potential machine-versus-human patterns; for instance, identity aversion means that identical artworks attributed to machines versus humans become less appreciated, whereas content aversion describes that machine-generated artworks are less appreciated. In four preregistered experiments (portrait painting, landscape painting, modern Chinese poetry, and classical Chinese poetry) conducted between November 2021 and January 2022, Chinese participants (n = 3,184) are told that the involved artwork—actually created by a human or AI—is from a human, AI, algorithm, or anonymous, and then give responses in comprehensibility, perceived quality, aesthetic emotion, and behavioral intention. Identity aversion receives less evidence than identity indifference, and identity appreciation receives no evidence. In the painting experiments, content aversion and content indifference are equivalently supported; in the poetry experiments, content indifference is dominant but both content aversion and appreciation exist in few comparisons. Overall, we report mixed evidence regarding laypeople’s aversion around machines across these experiments.

REC_04651,When the bot walks the talk: Investigating the foundations of trust in an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot,"The concept of trust in artificial intelligence (AI) has been gaining increasing relevance for understanding and shaping human interaction with AI systems. Despite a growing literature, there are disputes as to whether the processes of trust in AI are similar to that of interpersonal trust (i.e., in fellow humans). The aim of the present article is twofold. First, we provide a systematic test of an integrative model of trust inspired by interpersonal trust research encompassing trust, its antecedents (trustworthiness and trust propensity), and its consequences (intentions to use the AI and willingness to disclose personal information). Second, we investigate the role of AI personalization on trust and trustworthiness, considering both their mean levels and their dynamic relationships. In two pilot studies (N = 313) and one main study (N = 1,001) focusing on AI chatbots, we find that the integrative model of trust is suitable for the study of trust in virtual AI. Perceived trustworthiness of the AI, and more specifically its ability and integrity dimensions, is a significant antecedent of trust and so are anthropomorphism and propensity to trust smart technology. Trust, in turn, leads to greater intentions to use and willingness to disclose information to the AI. The personalized AI chatbot was perceived as more able and benevolent than the impersonal chatbot. It was also more anthropomorphized and led to greater usage intentions, but not to greater trust. Anthropomorphism, not trust, explained the greater intentions to use personalized AI. We discuss implications for research on trust in humans and in automation.

To test this proposal, we conducted a 2 (error type: recognition vs. execution error) × 2 (feedback elaboration: present vs. absent) mixed-design experiment in which users interacted with a VUI speaker and evaluated its usability in these four modes. Participants reported greater acceptance of feedback and higher usability perception for a speaker returning execution errors than for one returning recognition errors, particularly when the speaker presented feedback articulating reasons for the errors. This finding indicates that a VUI can employ feedback explaining the causes of errors to facilitate the development of common ground and to minimize the negative consequences of errors.

Drawing on the Interplay of Modality, Person, Area, Country/Culture, and Transparency categories (IMPACT) framework, this study aims to investigate the interplay of locus of control (LOC), belief in conspiracy theories, and the perception of the importance and availability of eXplainable AI (XAI) on attitudes towards AI (measured via AI acceptance and fear). The study used an online survey with 281 participants from the UK and 281 from the Arab world. Statistical analysis revealed that in the UK but not in the Arab sample, female participants reported higher fear of AI and lower acceptance of AI compared to males. The regression results consistently confirmed the role of internal LOC, perceived XAI importance, and perceived availability of XAI in fostering AI acceptance, as well as the role of belief in conspiracy theories, external LOC, and perceiving availability of XAI as being low in increasing fear of AI. The perceived availability of XAI emerges as a crucial influencing factor; addressing it appropriately could enhance societal awareness and acceptance of AI while reducing fear.

This article presents findings from a research project at the School of Information and Communication Studies, University College Dublin (UCD), entitled Generative Artificial Intelligence in Education: Exploring Student Perceptions and Use of Large Language Models (LLMs). An online survey of 1,553 undergraduate and graduate students in UCD College of Social Sciences and Law produced deep insights into their perceptions, attitudes, challenges, and concerns regarding the use of large language model-based GenAI chatbots in academic contexts. This paper focuses on the students' responses relating to the type of training that they perceive they need to be able to use GenAI chatbots ethically, productively, and within the boundaries ofwhat is permitted in their academic education. In addition to extending our emerging understanding of students' knowledge and perceptions of GenAI, the study findings provide useful insight and guidance to educators in higher education institutions who wish to lean in and integrate, rather than exclude, GenAI tools in their pedagogical approaches.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.35,0.38,,,"Title hints at surveying ChatGPT use in education, but without the abstract I can’t confirm empirical quantitative methods, sample size ≥50, adoption metrics, or reported statistics—so inclusion is unclear.","Codex-sub(gpt-5.1-codex-mini): Survey of 1,553 students in higher ed on GenAI perceptions/uses meets the empirical/size/context criteria, but abstract doesn’t make clear whether it reports adoption/acceptance measures or statistical relationships, so can’t confirm inclusion yet.",uncertain,retry_codex_for_t2,oauth,,,,,,,T2_single_ai,gpt-5.1-codex-mini,,MEDIUM,genuine_uncertain
REC_01458,AI-based chatbot interactions and critical thinking skills: An exploratory study,"The widespread adoption of AI-driven chatbots has ushered in a transformative era in human-machine interaction. Notably, systems such as ChatGPT, proficient in furnishing personalized and immediate responses, have markedly elevated user experience and facilitated more seamless and intuitive communication with machines. Nonetheless, the ramifications of this interaction on cognitive processes, particularly on the capacity for intricate critical thinking, remain inadequately explored. This study aimed to investigate the influence of engaging with ChatGPT on the use of complex critical thinking skills within a cohort of Italian users. A total of 126 participants took part in the study. They completed self-report questionnaires designed to gauge their familiarity and experience with ChatGPT. They also underwent an evaluation of their critical thinking performance using the Critical Reasoning Assessment (CRA). The findings revealed that increased knowledge and experience with ChatGPT, when coupled with cautious use, enhanced critical thinking abilities. These findings underscore the potential of conscientious interaction with ChatGPT as a valuable tool for augmenting users’ proficiency in critical thinking.

REC_10811,"Artificial intelligence literacy among Chinese Master of Education students: Current situation, influencing factors and generative pathways","As future high-quality educators, Master of Education students’ levels of artificial intelligence literacy (AIL) directly influence the quality of future talent cultivation. The study, grounded in the technological pedagogical content knowledge framework and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, employed covariance-based structural equation modelling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis to empirically examine the AIL of 1,575 Master of Education students in China. The findings reveal that the overall level of AIL is moderate. Students scored lower in knowledge, competence and thinking dimensions than in attitudes and ethics. Significant differences in AIL were observed across gender, institutional type, affiliation and regional location. Effort expectancy, performance expectancy, behavioural intention, facilitating conditions, social influence and technological pedagogical content knowledge all showed significant positive effects on AIL. Moreover, AIL is shaped by the complex interplay of multiple influencing factors. The high AIL level includes three generative paths: external support-driven, cognitive-social synergy and self directed development. Conversely, the low AIL level includes two generative paths: weak cognitive ability and motivation-social deficit. Implications for practice or policy: Universities should require AIL in all Master of Education programmes through discipline-integrated modules. Governments must reduce regional disparities by funding digital infrastructure and collaborative platforms for under-resourced institutions. Universities should tackle gender gaps via targeted support, peer mentoring and inclusive AI teaching practices. Universities should partner with technology companies to develop adaptable, secure AI tools suited to varied disciplines and teaching contexts. ©Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

REC_10818,Factors affecting Chinese undergraduate medical students’ behavioural intention and actual use of intelligent tutoring systems,"This study examined Chinese undergraduate medical students’ acceptance and adoption of intelligent tutoring systems (ITSs) using the general extended technology acceptance model for e-learning via a Likert-scale questionnaire. Specifically, it examined the relations between the five antecedents and the four core components in the model (i.e., perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), behavioural intention and actual use of ITSs). The results of PLS-SEM showed that perceived enjoyment was the most influential antecedent as it significantly impacted both PU and PEOU. Both self-efficacy and prior experience only significantly contributed to PEOU but not PU. Both PU and PEOU significantly and positively predicted behavioural intention, which in turn had a significant and positive path to actual use. The results provide some practical implications to teachers as to how to encourage Chinese undergraduate medical students’ adoption of ITSs: by integrating some gamification elements into the learning activities in ITSs to foster students’ enjoyable feelings or familiarising students with using ITSs so that they can quickly adapt to learning through them. This could be achieved by providing guidance in using ITSs via videos, websites or booklets, or at the beginning of the course, inviting senior students to share their perceived advantages and usefulness of using ITSs. ©: Articles published in the Australasian Journal of Educational Technology (AJET) are available under Creative Commons Attribution Non-Commercial No Derivatives Licence (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0).

The developed AIGCT-SI model incorporates key elements such as information accuracy, trust, and privacy concerns. PLS-SEM results indicate that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and habit significantly impact students' intentions, with trust acting as a key mediator, particularly for privacy concerns and social influence. FsQCA reveals seven configurations, demonstrating how combinations of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions drive adoption. A bidirectional relationship between privacy concerns and trust is observed, with trust mitigating privacy risks in several configurations. This integrative approach highlights the complex dynamics of AIGC tool adoption and provides strategic insights for their effective use in Chinese graduate education.

We chose Brazil and the United States, as they are leading countries in terms of AI adoption in Latin America and North America, respectively. Methodology: This study used a mixed-methods approach of combining online surveys and in-person interviews with college students majoring in journalism and mass communications in Brazil and the United States. Main findings: Our findings identified similarities and differences between the two groups in terms of familiarity with AI, perceived AI efficiency, concerns about AI, AI self-efficacy, intention to learn about AI, and career optimism. For example, our research showed that students with higher levels of familiarity with AI and perceived efficiency demonstrated higher levels of AI self-efficacy. These college students are optimistic about potential benefits of AI, while at the same time exhibiting concern about its negative consequences. Social implications: Given the rapidly growing deployment of AI in media and other related fields around the world, it is important that journalism and mass communications programs update their curriculum to help students better prepare for their future careers. In doing so, we should include voices of instructors and students in journalism and mass communications programs across the globe so that our approaches to the topic reflect realities and aspirations of countries with different levels of AI adoption and use. Practical implications: Our research highlight needs for instructors to be better educated on AI so they can lead thoughtful, nuanced, and substantive discussions on AI in their classrooms. Academic associations including the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication could serve as information and networking hubs for developing curriculum around this topic and sharing lessons learned among instructors.

REC_09726,Perceptions and attitudes of dental students and dentists in South Korea toward artificial intelligence: a subgroup analysis based on professional seniority,"Background This study explored dental students' and dentists' perceptions and attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) and analyzed differences according to professional seniority. Methods In September to November 2022, online surveys using Google Forms were conducted at 2 dental colleges and on 2 dental websites. The questionnaire consisted of general information (8 or 10 items) and participants' perceptions, confidence, predictions, and perceived future prospects regarding AI (17 items). A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed on 4 questions representing perceptions and attitudes toward AI to identify highly influential factors according to position, age, sex, residence, and self-reported knowledge level about AI of respondents. Participants were reclassified into 2 subgroups based on students' years in school and 4 subgroups based on dentists' years of experience. The chi-square test or Fisher's exact test was used to determine differences between dental students and dentists and between subgroups for all 17 questions. Results The study included 120 dental students and 96 dentists. Participants with high level of AI knowledge were more likely to be interested in AI compared to those with moderate or low level (adjusted OR 24.345, p < 0.001). Most dental students (60.8%) and dentists (67.7%) predicted that dental AI would complement human limitations. Dental students responded that they would actively use AI in almost all cases (40.8%), while dentists responded that they would use AI only when necessary (44.8%). Dentists with 11-20 years of experience were the most likely to disagree that AI could outperform skilled dentists (50.0%), and respondents with longer careers had higher response rates regarding the need for AI education in schools. Conclusions Knowledge level about AI emerged as the factor influencing perceptions and attitudes toward AI, with both dental students and dentists showing similar views on recognizing the potential of AI as an auxiliary tool. However, students' and dentists' willingness to use AI differed. Although dentists differed in their confidence in the abilities of AI, all dentists recognized the need for education on AI.

REC_12494,Understanding higher education students' adoption of generative AI technologies: An empirical investigation using UTAUT2,"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies are gaining traction in higher education, offering potential benefits such as personalized learning support and enhanced productivity. However, successful integration requires understanding the factors influencing students' adoption of these emerging tools. This study investigates the determinants shaping higher education students' adoption of GAI through the lens of the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 framework. Data was collected from Pyatigorsk State University students and analyzed using structural equation modeling. The findings reveal habit (HB) as the most influential predictor of GAI adoption among students, followed by performance expectancy. Hedonic motivation, social influence (SI), and price value positively influenced behavioral intention (BI) to use these technologies. Surprisingly, facilitating conditions (FCs) exhibited a negative effect on BI, suggesting potential gaps in support systems. The study identifies no significant gender differences in the underlying factors driving adoption. Based on the results, recommendations are provided to foster HB formation, communicate benefits, enhance hedonic appeal, leverage SI, address price concerns, and strengthen FCs. Potential limitations include the cross-sectional nature of the data, geographic constraints, reliance on self-reported measures, and the lack of consideration for individual differences as moderators.

REC_06050,The adoption and effective use of artificial intelligence in Moroccan higher education: the moderating role of trust,"In a context where artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming pedagogical practices, higher education (HE) methods increasingly integrate intelligent systems to enrich learning. Despite growing interest, research often relies on traditional models such as the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), which insufficiently address trust-related concerns specific to AI. This study fills that gap by examining factors influencing AI adoption and effective use in HE. It builds on an extended TAM, incorporating perceived efficiency, ease of use, usefulness and trust as a moderating variable, thereby integrating psychological and ethical dimensions often overlooked. Trust is treated not merely as a side factor but as central to moving from intention to sustained use, especially when interacting with autonomous systems. Data were collected via a questionnaire targeting diverse HE stakeholders, ensuring representativeness. The Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) method validated hypothesized relationships. Results confirm that perceived efficiency, usefulness and ease of use significantly influence adoption, which in turn strongly predicts effective use. Trust positively moderates the adoption-use link, reinforcing transition from intention to action. This highlights the need to integrate trust into acceptance models to enhance AI's successful institutional integration. Theoretically, the study extends TAM to contexts where ethical and trust dynamics are critical. Practically, it suggests that strategies to promote AI adoption must go beyond functional benefits, actively fostering trust through transparent communication, ethical design principles and robust user support.

The integration of AI knowledge into medical education is essential to equip future healthcare professionals with the skills needed to effectively leverage these advancements in their practices. Despite its significance, many medical schools have yet to incorporate AI into their curricula. This study aims to assess the attitudes of medical students in Thailand toward AI and its application in radiology, with the objective of better planning for its inclusion.MethodsBetween February and June 2022, we conducted a survey in two Thai medical schools: Chiang Mai University in Northern Thailand and Prince of Songkla University in Southern Thailand. We employed 5-point Likert scale questions (ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree) to evaluate students' opinions on three main aspects: (1) their understanding of AI, (2) the inclusion of AI in their medical education, and (3) the potential impact of AI on medicine and radiology.ResultsOur findings revealed that merely 31% of medical students perceived to have a basic understanding of AI. Nevertheless, nearly all students (93.6%) recognized the value of AI training for their careers and strongly advocated for its inclusion in the medical school curriculum. Furthermore, those students who had a better understanding of AI were more likely to believe that AI would revolutionize the field of radiology (p = 0.02), making it more captivating and impactful (p = 0.04).ConclusionOur study highlights a noticeable gap in the understanding of AI among medical students in Thailand and its practical applications in healthcare.

REC_12098,Modeling AI-Enhanced Learning for Sustainable Cognitive Development: A UTAUT2 and Bloom’s Taxonomy Perspective,"Background/purpose. This study examines the behavioral factors influencing the adoption of AI-powered generative technologies in higher education and their impact on students’ cognitive engagement—a crucial element of sustainable, inclusive, and high-quality learning, as envisioned by UNESCO’s Sustainable Development Goal 4 (SDG4). The study combines Bloom’s Taxonomy hierarchical structure with the expanded Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) framework. Materials/methods. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was utilized to analyze data collected from a sample of 731 university students, aiming to identify the key determinants of GenAI adoption and to assess its subsequent effects across six distinct cognitive domains. Results. The SEM analysis reveals that performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation have a significant influence on AI adoption, underscoring the importance of usefulness, support, and enjoyment in promoting student engagement. The study demonstrates that the adoption of GenAI significantly predicts student engagement, which in turn acts as a critical mediator in enhancing mid-level cognitive performance by improving understanding, application and analysis abilities. In contrast, marginal impacts were found in evaluation and creation domains while remembering did not demonstrate any significant effect. Conclusion. The study provides evidence-based insights for educators, curriculum designers, and policymakers seeking to leverage GenAI as part of equitable, student-centered, and cognitively enriching AI-enabled learning environments. © The Author(s), 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08634,Understanding the Effect of Risk Perception on the Acceptance and Use of Large Language Models Among University Students,"The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in education introduced powerful tools such as ChatGPT, which students increasingly use for academic purposes. However, these technologies present significant challenges for higher education, such as the risk of undermining academic integrity through AI-assisted performance and the uncertainty around proper use. This paper seeks to understand the benefits and risks university students perceive regarding LLM usage and how those influence their acceptance and use of related services in higher education. To this end, we employed a mixed-method approach. Using the UTAUT2 model extended by a Risk Expectancy construct, we conducted an online survey and follow-up interviews with university students. The results indicated that while students perceive considerable risks related to LLMs, those do not impact their usage and behavioral intention.

REC_05020,"When artificial intelligence substitutes humans in higher education: the cost of loneliness, student success, and retention","Artificial intelligence (AI) may be the new-new-norm in a post-pandemic learning environment. There is a growing number of university students using AI like ChatGPT and Bard to support their academic experience. Much of the AI in higher education research to date has focused on academic integrity and matters of authorship; yet, there may be unintended consequences beyond these concerns for students. That is, there may be people who reduce their formal social interactions while using these tools. This study evaluates 387 university students and their relationship to - and with - artificial intelligence large-language model-based tools. Using structural equation modelling, the study finds evidence that while AI chatbots designed for information provision may be associated with student performance, when social support, psychological wellbeing, loneliness, and sense of belonging are considered it has a net negative effect on achievement. This study tests an AI-specific form of social support, and the cost it may pose to student success, wellbeing, and retention. Indeed, while AI chatbot usage may be associated with poorer social outcomes, human-substitution activity that may be occurring when a student chooses to seek support from an AI rather than a human (e.g. a librarian, professor, or student advisor) may pose interesting learning and teaching policy implications. We explore the implications of this from the lens of student success and belonging.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12099,Integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence and 3D Immersive Environments in Competency-Based Higher Education,"Background/purpose. The incorporation of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into higher education is transforming competency-based learning by enabling adaptive, interactive, and immersive environments. This study aimed to design and evaluate an innovation mechanism that integrates AI agents with 3D interfaces, focusing not only on technical feasibility but also on pedagogical contribution, including motivation, personalization, and competency development. Materials/methods. Three AI systems—Ser, Edu, and Male—were developed at Universidad Sergio Arboleda and integrated into Unity-based 3D environments. The modular architecture combined voice-to-text, large language model processing, summarization, and text-to-speech. A mixed-methods approach was employed with instructors at the School of Aeronautical Instruction, including surveys, focus groups, and learning analytics to capture interaction data. Results. Findings showed high acceptance: 81% of instructors reported motivation to use the system, while 68% perceived AI as a complement to teaching. Whisper achieved 93% transcription accuracy, and response latency averaged under 2.5 seconds. Over 3,100 interactions were recorded, mainly focused on rubric design, motivational strategies, and instructional materials. Teachers highlighted the pedagogical value of AI-generated bullet-point summaries for reducing cognitive load and organizing content. Conclusion. The study demonstrates that generative AI integrated with 3D immersive environments can reconceptualize the teaching role from content delivery to pedagogical design. Beyond technical performance, the system enhanced personalization, engagement, and competency-based instruction. These results provide evidence of AI’s potential as a pedagogical ally and offer practical insights for scaling innovation in curriculum design and teacher training. © The Author(s), 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.31,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05021,ChatGPT adoption and anxiety: a cross-country analysis utilising the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT),"The public release of ChatGPT in November 2022 brought excitement and concerns regarding students' use of language models in higher education. However, little research has empirically investigated students' intention to adopt ChatGPT. This study developed a theoretical model based on the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with an additional construct- anxiety, to investigate university students' adoption intention of ChatGPT in two higher education contexts- the UK and Nepal. 239 and 226 questionnaires were deemed sufficient for data analysis for Nepal and the UK, respectively. We utilised the structural equation modelling technique to test the hypotheses. Our results reveal that performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence significantly impacted the adoption intention of ChatGPT for both countries. However, anxiety's impact varied between Nepal and the UK. Integrating UTAUT with a cross-country comparative approach provides insights into how ChatGPT's reception diverges between different higher education contexts.

REC_12112,Impact of Inspirational Film Appreciation Courses on College Students by Voice Interaction System and Artificial Intelligence,"To improve the mental health education level of college students and promote the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in college education, freshmen from a university are selected as research subjects. Two classes are chosen, with 40 students in each, and they are assigned as the experimental and control groups, respectively. The analysis of the voice interaction system of campus psychological consultation is combined with self-efficacy. The Sixteen Personality Factor Questionnaire (16PF) and the General Self-Efficacy Scale are adopted to analyze the mental health of the two groups of students at the beginning and the end of the semester. The interactive technology in AI is applied to construct a user mental model to achieve voice interaction designing. Knowledge base matching is performed on students' interactive input text, and long short-term memory (LSTM) is adopted to analyze the sentiment type of the input information and then classify it. Moreover, the answer with higher voice confidence is returned as the candidate's answer to the machine. After that, the possible text of each candidate answer is predicted and analyzed according to the interactive condition probability, and the optimal result is fed back to the student interface. Then, it points out the effect of the proposed method in analyzing the influence of inspirational film appreciation courses on the mental health level of college students. The results show a significant difference in the sensitivity factor in the experiment results at the beginning of the semester (P<0.05). Meanwhile, the difference in the automaticity factor is very significant (P<0.05). Both sensitivity and automaticity factors show different variations than expected in the experimental data at the beginning of the semester, especially the changes in automaticity factors. At the end of the semester, there are no significant differences in the sensitivity and self-discipline of the students. Moreover, it significantly influences students in the experimental group after enjoying the inspirational film, especially in terms of interpersonal communication and emotional management, positively impacting students' mental health. Meanwhile, the students in the experimental group adopt the voice interactive system for mental health consultation, and the machine can give some references to protect students' privacy to a certain extent. Therefore, when adopted to analyze the impact of inspirational film appreciation courses on the mental health of college students, the voice interaction system for campus psychological consultation under AI combined with self-efficacy has a positive effect. It also contributes to recommending college mental health education and the adoption of AI in college education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13164,A Radial Basis Function Neural Network Approach to Predict Preschool Teachers' Technology Acceptance Behavior,"With the continual development of artificial intelligence and smart computing in recent years, quantitative approaches have become increasingly popular as an efficient modeling tool as they do not necessitate complicated mathematical models. Many nations have taken steps, such as transitioning to online schooling, to decrease the harm caused by coronaviruses. Inspired by the demand for technology in early education, the present research uses a radial basis function (RBF) neural network (NN) modeling technique to predict preschool instructors' technology usage in classes based on recognized determinant characteristics of technology acceptance. In this regard, this study utilized the RBFNN approach to predict preschool teachers' technology acceptance behavior, based on the theory of planned behavior, which states that behavioral achievement, in our case the actual technology use in class, depends on motivation, intention and ability, and behavioral control. Thus, this research design is based on an adapted version of the technology acceptance model (TAM) with eight dimensions: D1. Perceived usefulness, D2. Perceived ease of use, D3. Perceived enjoyment, D4. Intention to use, D5. Actual use, D6. Compatibility, D7. Attitude, and D8. Self-efficacy. According to the TAM, actual usage is significantly predicted by the other seven dimensions used in this research. Instead of using the classical multiple linear regression statistical processing of data, we opted for a NN based on the RBF approach to predict the actual usage behavior. This study included 182 preschool teachers who were randomly chosen from a project-based national preschool teacher training program and who responded to our online questionnaire. After designing the RBF function with the actual usage as an output variable and the other seven dimensions as input variables, in the model summary, we obtained in the training sample a sum of squares error of 37.5 and a percent of incorrect predictions of 43.3%. In the testing sample, we obtained a sum of squares error of 14.88 and a percent of incorrect predictions of 37%. Thus, we can conclude that 63% of the classified data are correctly assigned to the models' dependent variable, i.e., actual technology use, which is a significant rate of correct predictions in the testing sample. This high significant percentage of correct classification represents an important result, mainly because this is the first study to apply RBFNN's prediction on psychological data, opening up a new interdisciplinary field of research.",2022,WoS; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,codex timed out after 300s,"The abstract is missing.

Data from 400 university students in China were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results reveal that novelty value acts as a powerful catalyst, substantially boosting performance expectancy and diminishing effort expectancy. Furthermore, this study delineates a dual-pathway mechanism where performance and effort expectancies shape both emotions and trust, which in turn directly determine adoption intention-with emotion exhibiting the stronger influence. Theoretically, this research validates an extended AIDUA model, highlighting the critical roles of sustained innovation perception and cognitive-affective dual pathways.

Employing a fusion of the UTAUT (Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology) model and the ECM (Expectation-Confirmation Model), the research seeks to pinpoint the pivotal factors influencing students' attitudes, satisfaction, and behavioral intentions regarding AI Chatbots. The study constructs a model comprising seven substantial predictors aimed at precisely foreseeing users' intentions and behavior with AI Chatbots. Collected from 373 students enrolled in various universities across China, the self-reported data is subject to analysis using the partial-least squares method of structural equation modeling to confirm the model's reliability and validity. The findings validate seven out of the eleven proposed hypotheses, underscoring the influential role of ECM constructs, particularly Confirmation and Satisfaction, outweighing the impact of UTAUT constructs on users' behavior. Specifically, users' perceived confirmation significantly influences their satisfaction and subsequent intention to continue using AI Chatbots. Additionally, Personal innovativeness emerges as a critical determinant shaping users' behavioral intention.

REC_07097,Factors affecting students' preparedness for the fourth industrial revolution in higher education institutions,"Purpose - Knowing the students' readiness for the fourth industrial revolution (4IR) is essential to producing competent, knowledgeable and skilled graduates who can contribute to the skilled workforce in the country. This will assist the Higher Education Institutions (HEIs) to ensure that their graduates own skill sets needed to work in the 4IR era. However, studies on students' readiness and preparedness for the 4IR in developing countries such as the Sultanate of Oman are still lacking. Therefore, this study investigates students' readiness level and preparedness for the 4IR. The findings of this study will benefit the HEIs policymakers, administration, faculties, departments, industries and society at large since they will be informed of the student's readiness and preparedness toward industry 4.0. Design/methodology/approach - The authors adopted the measures from the same context as previous studies in this study. The questionnaire was divided into three sections; the first part described the purpose and introduction of the search with the surety to keep the data confidential. The second part consisted of demographical information like gender, education. The last parts consisted of four subsections, question items in these parts are based on the related previous study. Characteristics consisted of 14 items, knowledge consisted of 18 items related to 4IR technologies, Organizational Dimension comprised of four items related to academic programs, curriculum and training. Preparedness contained two items. The participants have rated all the items in 5-Likert scale. Findings - Results from structural equation modeling showed that students' characteristics, knowledge of 4IR technologies and organizational dimensions significantly impact their preparedness for the 4IR. The study also found that organizational dimensions have the highest impact on students' preparedness. Furthermore, the organizational dimension significantly influences students' knowledge of 4IR technology. Moreover, students' characteristics related to 4IR are significantly affected by their knowledge of 4IR technology and organizational dimension. The findings suggest that HEIs are responsible for increasing the adoption of 4IR, and therefore organizational dimensions such as the academic programs, training, technological infrastructure and others are all critical for preparing students for a better future and should be given a priority. Research limitations/implications - This study has used academic programs and training to measure the organizational dimension. However, other important factors should be considered, such as technological infrastructure and leadership and governance of HEIs. Second, the current research depends on quantitative data, so future research should implement a mixed methodology (questionnaires, depth interviews, document analysis and focus group) to understand the factors affecting students' readiness for 4IR clearly. Finally, although the 4IR has numerous benefits, it also has challenges in its implementation, so future studies should focus on challenges encountered by different stakeholders in implementing 4IRrelated technologies. Practical implications - The curriculum must include mandatory courses related to IT infrastructure design, user experience programming, electronic measurement and control principles, and programming for data science. HEIs should also foster interdisciplinary knowledge by integrating IT, Engineering, Business and Sciences. Furthermore, the HEIs should develop their infrastructure to have smart campuses, labs, classrooms and libraries to make HEIs a space where knowledge can be generated and innovative solutions can be proposed. This entails HEIs offering necessary hardware, software and technical support because if the HEIs improve their technological resources, students will be capable of using 4IR-related technologies effectively. Originality/value - The advancement of technology has resulted in the emergence of the Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR), such as artificial intelligence, blockchain, robotics, cloud computing, data science, virtual reality and 3D printing. It is essential to investigate students' readiness for 4IR. However, there is no study as per researchers' knowledge talked about students readiness in HEIs in the Arab world. This study could be a basis for more research on students' perception of the 4IR covering students from various backgrounds and levels.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,"E2,E4","codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05025,Technology empowerment or risk avoidance? - investigating the overlooked factors influencing college students' acceptance of generative artificial intelligence,"Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) is transforming higher education by enhancing learning tools, enabling personalized instruction, and streamlining administrative processes. However, colleges around the world have divergent policy positions on its educational use. In China, the use of international platforms such as ChatGPT is explicitly restricted within higher education institutions, while domestic colleges are simultaneously encouraged to explore effective pathways for integrating GAI into teaching and learning. Against this unique regulatory and educational background, this study examines Chinese college students' adoption of GAI using an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model that incorporates perceived risk as an additional construct. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was applied to analyze survey data from 524 students. The findings reveal that performance expectancy and social influence significantly increase students' intention to use GAI. Facilitating conditions and behavioral intention also strongly predict actual usage behavior.

REC_05055,Exploring the adoption of generative artificial intelligence tools among university teachers,"Generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI) has quickly become a versatile teaching tool available to both students and university teachers. However, its acceptance is not yet universal among teachers. Understanding the factors that influence their intention to use these tools in the future is crucial for higher education administrators to design policies that promote the responsible and ethical use of this new technology. Based on the C-TAM-TPB model, this research proposes a structural equation model suggesting that university teachers' intention to use Gen-AI tools is determined by their attitude towards it, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, social norms, and personal innovativeness. This model was tested with a sample of 896 teachers from all Spanish universities and all fields of knowledge. The results highlight the significant impact of both attitude towards the technology and perceived usefulness on the intention to use it. Perceived usefulness influences the intention to use directly and indirectly through attitude towards the technology. Perceived ease of use and personal innovativeness have much less influence. Additionally, social norms do not significantly affect the intention to use.

Adopting a convergent mixed-method design, the research involved students enrolled in the ICT for ELT course at a university in West Kalimantan, Indonesia, and applied the Technology Acceptance Model to explore the relationships among key variables. Ninety-five English as a Foreign Language (EFL) students participated in a four-week take-home assignment using a writing prompt provided by their lecturer. Qualitative data were collected through an open-ended questionnaire, which revealed that students' acceptance of ChatGPT was attributed to its user-friendly interface and ability to interact in their native language. Path analysis revealed that perceived ease of use positively influenced both perceived usefulness and attitude toward change, while perceived usefulness also positively affected attitude toward change. In turn, a positive attitude toward changes significantly impacted students' behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT. Integrating qualitative and quantitative findings, this study suggests that ChatGPT fostered a positive attitude toward technological change and encouraged students to adopt it more frequently. Notably, students primarily used ChatGPT as a writing aid rather than for generating complete essays, suggesting the potential for using ChatGPT under instructor supervision to diminish risks of dishonesty in academic writing.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08688,Exploring EFL Teachers' Behavioral Intentions to Integrate GenAI Applications: Insights From PLS-SEM and fsQCA,"The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) applications has opened new possibilities across various fields, including English language education, by enabling personalized and adaptable learning experiences. Responding to the growing trend of integrating GenAI tools into EFL instruction, this study explored Iranian teachers' behavioral intentions to use GenAI applications, such as ChatGPT, for English teaching in higher education. Anchored in the UTAUT framework, the study examined external factors influencing adoption intentions, while the TPACK model assessed internal factors tied to instructors' AI usage. A structural model featuring 20 hypotheses based on the UTAUT and AI-TPACK was proposed. Data were gathered from 444 Iranian EFL teachers via an online survey and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). The results highlighted the critical roles of performance expectancy and social influence in shaping adoption intentions. Interestingly, a negative relationship between AI-TPACK and behavioral intentions revealed a paradox: Deeper technological knowledge may hinder, rather than facilitate, AI adoption in teaching. Key drivers of adoption included teachers' perceptions of GenAI's potential to enhance instructional performance and support from social networks. Effort expectancy, however, was less significant in this context. The study also identified sociocultural and institutional challenges as crucial barriers, underscoring the need to address these for sustained AI integration. This research enriches the literature by uncovering enablers and barriers to GenAI adoption, offering valuable insights into the sociocultural and institutional dynamics influencing technology integration in diverse educational settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,E4,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05682,Widely used but barely trusted: understanding student perceptions on the use of generative AI in higher education,"The rapid proliferation of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) tools such as ChatGPT is transforming how students learn, create and engage with knowledge. Yet, little is known about how students in Higher Education perceive and use GAI, or how their perceptions differ across demographic groups. This study addresses this gap by examining student subjective perceptions on GAI through a questionnaire of 132 undergraduate and postgraduate students from six UK Universities, conducted in early 2024. We analyse attitudes towards usage, plagiarism, reliability and the perceived impact of GAI on the learning process, focussing on differences by gender and domicile status (UK vs. non-UK students). Our findings reveal a paradox: GAI is widely used but barely trusted. Particularly, we show that students are increasingly eager to adopt GAI for completion of coursework, assignments and other non-academic tasks, but fewer than 25% regard its outputs as reliable. Furthermore, we find differences in perceptions across student groups, with international and male students reporting higher usage and more permissive attitudes towards AI-assisted learning. These results suggest that (i) GAI adoption is driven by its usefulness and accessibility rather than by trust in the outputs, and (ii) there is a need for inclusive teaching approaches that help all students, regardless of their background, engage confidently and responsibly with GAI in their learning. © 2025 The Author(s).

REC_07121,DO or D.O.! When AI helps and when it hinders doctoral persistence,"Purpose – This study aims to investigate the relationships between dissertation self-efficacy, academic buoyancy, flow experience, and persistence intention among doctoral students, and to examine the moderating role of AI usage in AI-enhanced academic writing. Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected from 426 doctoral students using purposive sampling. Exploratory factor analysis was conducted to identify the dimensions of dissertation self-efficacy, and structural equation modeling was used to test the hypothesized relationships and the moderating effects of AI usage. Findings – The study found that AI usage had a significant negative moderating effect on the relationship between flow experience and persistence intention. Additionally, dissertation self-efficacy, consisting of research implementation, self-management, and research competence, significantly influenced academic buoyancy and flow experience, which in turn affected persistence intention. Research limitations/implications – The cross-sectional design of the study limits the ability to draw causal conclusions. The sampling method may introduce survivorship bias, and the measurement of AI usage does not differentiate between specific applications or usage patterns. Future research should track students over time and capture detailed metrics on their AI usage to better understand its impact. Practical implications – AI usage impedes doctoral persistence. Students who heavily use AI are less likely to complete their degrees. This finding requires immediate institutional action. Universities should teach doctoral students that while AI can assist with routine tasks, overreliance undermines critical thinking and problem-solving essential for doctoral success. AI should support, not substitute, doctoral education. Originality/value – This study extends Social Cognitive Career Theory by integrating academic buoyancy and flow theories in the doctoral context and provides new insights into how AI usage can undermine the psychological mechanisms that drive doctoral students’ persistence. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13315,Mindfulness and AI adoption: extending the technology acceptance model for Chinese media students,"Introduction Media students' acceptance and use of intelligent technology requires not only external environmental support but also the stimulation of internal driving forces. This study incorporates mindfulness into the classical Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to investigate its role in shaping students' perceptions and behavioral intentions toward artificial intelligence (AI) tools. Specifically, the research examines: (1) the impact of mindfulness on media students' perceptions of AI technology; (2) the influence of mindfulness on their continuous intention to use AI technology; and (3) the moderating effect of perceived risk on the intention to adopt AI tools.Methods Based on a conceptual model integrating mindfulness with TAM, this study conducted an offline questionnaire survey among 588 media students. The data were analyzed using SmartPLS and SPSS to test the structural equation modeling and moderating effects.Results The findings revealed three key outcomes. First, mindfulness exerts a significant, direct, and positive influence on personal innovativeness (PI), perceived usefulness (PU), and perceived ease of use (PEU). Second, PI functions as a mediating variable in the relationship between mindfulness and AI-based behavioral intention (AIBI). Third, perceived risk (PR) significantly weakens the relationships between PI, PU, and AIBI.Discussion This study demonstrates that mindfulness enhances media students' intention to adopt AI tools by strengthening their perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, and personal innovativeness.

REC_02907,Adoption of ChatGPT for students' learning effectiveness,"ChatGPT represents a state-of-the-art progression in artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technology, used extensively in various sectors to make human lives easier and more convenient. It may provide additional assistance with different pedagogical methods. This research examines the effectiveness of integrating ChatGPT as an educational resource in student learning. A total of 505 responses were collected from university students located in Malaysia. The data were processed in SmartPLS 4.0 using the partial least squares with structural equation modelling technique. Findings reveal that tech competency has a positive impact on ChatGPT literacy and transparency; however, it has no significant impact on the adoption of ChatGPT. Additionally, ChatGPT's literacy and transparency have a significant impact on its adoption. Transparency acts as a mediator in the relationship between tech competency and ChatGPT adoption. On the other hand, ChatGPT literacy does not mediate the influence of tech competency on the adoption of ChatGPT. The impact of user innovativeness acts as a moderator on the influence of tech competency on ChatGPT literacy, transparency, and its adoption for learners' effectiveness. These results are informative for educational stakeholders who aim to enhance instructional design and refine the quality of learners' educational experiences by revealing the impact and prospects of ChatGPT as an educational tool.

REC_00013,Use of Ambient AI Scribes to Reduce Administrative Burden and Professional Burnout,"Importance While in short supply and high demand, ambulatory care clinicians spend more time on administrative tasks and documentation in the electronic health record than on direct patient care, which has been associated with burnout, intention to leave, and reduced quality of care. Objective To examine whether ambient AI scribes are associated with reducing clinician administrative burden and burnout. Design, Setting, and Participants This quality improvement study used preintervention and 30-day postintervention surveys to evaluate the use of the same ambient AI platform for clinical note documentation among ambulatory care physicians and advanced practice practitioners of 6 academic and community-based health care systems across the US. Clinicians were recruited by the health systems' digital health leaders; participation was voluntary. The study was conducted between February 1 and October 31, 2024. Exposure Use of an ambient AI scribe for 30 days. Main Outcomes and Measures The primary outcome was change in self-reported burnout, estimated using hierarchical logistic regression. Secondary outcomes of burnout evaluated were changes in note-related cognitive task load, focused attention on patients, patient understandability of notes, ability to add patients to the clinic schedule if urgently needed, and time spent documenting after hours. Outcome measures were linearly transformed to 10-point scales to ease interpretation and comparison. Differences between preintervention and postintervention scores were determined using paired t tests. Results Of the 451 clinicians enrolled, 272 completed the preintervention and postintervention surveys (60.3% completion rate), and 263 with direct patient care in ambulatory clinics (mean [SD] years in practice, 15.1 [9.3]; 141 female [53.6%]) were included in the analysis. The sample included 131 primary care practitioners (49.7%), 232 attending physicians (88.2%), and 168 academic faculty (63.9%). After 30 days with the ambient AI scribe, the proportion of participants experiencing burnout decreased significantly from 51.9% to 38.8% (odds ratio, 0.26; 95% CI, 0.13-0.54). On 10-point scales, the ambient AI scribe was associated with significant improvements in secondary outcomes of burnout (mean [SE] difference, 0.47 [0.12] points), note-related cognitive task load (mean [SE] difference, 2.64 [0.13] points), ability to provide undivided attention (mean [SE] difference, 2.05 [0.18] points), patient understandability of their care plans from reading the notes (mean [SE] difference, -0.44 [0.17] points), ability to add patients to the clinic schedule if urgently needed (mean [SE] difference, 0.51 [0.24] points), and time spent documenting after hours (mean [SE] difference, 0.90 [0.19] hours). Conclusions and Relevance This multicenter quality improvement study found that use of an ambient AI scribe platform was associated with a significant reduction in burnout, cognitive task load, and time spent documenting, as well as the perception that it could improve patient access to care and increase attention on patient concerns in an ambulatory environment. These findings suggest that AI may help reduce administrative burdens for clinicians and allow more time for meaningful work and professional well-being.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.2,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The conclusions derived, known as the Durkheim test, respond to the antonyms that are being formulated during the settlement of AI in educational discourses. Recognising that the act of educating today is nourished from the most libertarian pedagogies to those more driven by political agendas, there are multiple educational perspectives in relation to AI. In this diversity, the different fields of educational action may or may not adopt AI from an instrumental and/or social perspective. Despite the topicality of the subject, researchers are still lacking instruments to analyse the positions of the educational community in general and of the student stratum in particular. For this reason, the aim of this article is to adapt and validate two surveys that have shown excellent results in their original versions, as well as to analyse the relationship between the two. For this purpose, the adaptation of the technology acceptance survey and the AI literacy survey has been applied to a sample of 134 students from different Masters in Education programmes.

REC_14419,Vietnamese University Students’ Perceptions of ChatGPT for Homework Assistance,"Since its emergence, the novel ChatGPT has attracted lots of users. In education, the use of Chat GPT might provide both advantages and disadvantages for students. Likewise, the intention to use ChatGPT for learning is controversial in different contexts. In some contexts, students perceived ChatGPT as useful and easy to use, expressing their inclination to use this learning tool. Meanwhile, in other contexts, students were doubtful about ChatGPT’s benefits, leaning toward not using the tool for their learning. Therefore, it is worth gaining insight into students’ perceptions of ChatGPT in the current context. Drawing from the technology acceptance model (TAM), we explored how students perceived ChatGPT for their homework assignments. Data from mixed methods revealed that students have a moderately positive perception of using ChatGPT. Specifically, students have a positive attitude toward the use of ChatGPT and perceive it as useful and easy to use. More importantly, students have the intention of employing this tool for their future learning, despite several concerns. Data from structural equation modeling analyses demonstrated that perceived ease of use directly influences perceived usefulness. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use are predictors of students’ attitudes, which directly affect students’ intentions to use ChatGPT. The study provides empirical evidence to support the use of ChatGPT in education. Recommendations for using ChatGPT are discussed. © 2024 by the authors of this article.",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14429,Designing an AI-Supported Formative Assessment Model for Pre-Service Mathematics Teacher Self-Study in Vietnam,"Amid Vietnam’s accelerated digital transformation, teacher education is undergoing a pivotal shift—demanding innovative pedagogical and assessment strategies to foster self-directed learning (SDL) competencies. This need is particularly acute in Mathematics, a discipline that requires advanced logical reasoning, autonomy, and metacognitive engagement. In response, this study proposes a theoretically grounded and empirically validated formative assessment (FA) model designed to enhance SDL among pre-service primary Mathematics teachers. The model integrates both internal factors (e.g., motivation, metacognitive skills, and self-assessment competences) and external elements (e.g., technological tools, instructional support, and learning environments). Data were collected from 438 pre-service Mathematics teachers across multiple universities and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM). The findings identify two primary predictors of effective SDL: learners’ perceptions and attitudes toward FA and their intrinsic motivation and persistence. These factors significantly impact learning outcomes and are further amplified when supported by AI-driven tools and digital learning platforms. The study highlights the mediating role of technological and pedagogical scaffolds in strengthening SDL and emphasizes the critical integration of formative feedback, metacognitive strategies, and adaptive instructional design. Despite encouraging results, several challenges remain, including limited learner autonomy, inconsistent technology adoption, and reliance on instructor-led practices. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of how AI-enhanced FA can promote learner autonomy, critical thinking, and sustainable learning behaviors in Mathematics education. It offers actionable insights for policymakers and educators in designing resilient, context-sensitive teacher training frameworks aligned with the demands of the digital era. Future research should focus on piloting the model across diverse educational settings and leveraging big data and emerging technologies to improve predictive validity and pedagogical impact. © 2025 by the authors of this article.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13572,Adopting Generative AI in Higher Education: A Dual-Perspective Study of Students and Lecturers in Saudi Universities,"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as ChatGPT, into higher education has introduced new opportunities and challenges for students and lecturers alike. This study investigates the psychological, ethical, and institutional factors that shape the adoption of GenAI tools in Saudi Arabian universities, drawing on an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) that incorporates constructs from Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and ethical decision-making. A cross-sectional survey was administered to 578 undergraduate students and 309 university lecturers across three major institutions in Southern Saudi Arabia. Quantitative analysis using Structural Equation Modelling (SmartPLS 4) revealed that perceived usefulness, intrinsic motivation, and ethical trust significantly predicted students' intention to use GenAI. Perceived ease of use influenced intention both directly and indirectly through usefulness, while institutional support positively shaped perceptions of GenAI's value. Academic integrity and trust-related concerns emerged as key mediators of motivation, highlighting the ethical tensions in AI-assisted learning. Lecturer data revealed a parallel set of concerns, including fear of overreliance, diminished student effort, and erosion of assessment credibility. Although many faculty members had adapted their assessments in response to GenAI, institutional guidance was often perceived as lacking.

REC_00788,Influence of AI-driven educational tools on critical thinking dispositions among university students in Malaysia: a study of key factors and correlations,"This research examines the factors that affect critical thinking disposition (CTD) in Malaysian university students using AI-based educational technologies. It analyzes the impact of AI literacy (AIL), perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived usefulness (PU), and motivation (MO) through the lens of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Using a cross-sectional survey design, data were collected from 483 participants and analyzed through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results reveal that AIL, PU, and MO positively and significantly impact CTD, with motivation being the most critical factor. Contrary to expectations, PEOU was found to influence CTD negatively, thus suggesting that while ease of use is important, it may lead to superficial engagement, hindering the deep cognitive processing necessary for critical thinking. The study also confirms significant correlations among the predictors, highlighting that AI literacy enhances perceived ease of use, influencing perceived usefulness and ultimately boosting motivation. These findings underscore the importance of designing AI tools that balance user-friendliness with complexity to encourage critical engagement. Additionally, the study emphasizes the need to integrate AI literacy into higher education curricula to better prepare students for future challenges. The research contributes to the growing body of knowledge on AI-driven learning environments and fosters critical thinking skills. Future research is suggested to explore these relationships in different cultural contexts and to include qualitative approaches for a more comprehensive insight.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

However, limited evidence exists regarding the determinants of their acceptance and use, particularly in terms of psychosocial factors. This study aimed to extend the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by incorporating physical self-esteem (PSE) as a moderator and behavioural intention (BI) as a mediator within a single model. Data were collected through a validated questionnaire administered to 395 visually impaired undergraduates across five Saudi universities. Constructs included effort expectancy (EE), performance expectancy (PE), facilitating conditions (FCs), social influence (SI), BI, and PSE. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) was used for analysis. Results showed that PE and SI significantly predicted both BI and adoption, while EE strongly predicted BI but not AIAT adoption; FC had no significant influence on either outcome. BI positively affected AIAT adoption and mediated the effects of PE, EE, and SI, but not FC. Moderation analysis indicated that PSE strengthened the influence of PE, EE, and SI on BI and adoption. These findings underscore the significance of psychological factors, particularly self-esteem, in promoting the adoption of AIAT and offer guidance for developing inclusive educational strategies.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10604,Unveiling the adoption of metaverse technology in Bangkok metropolitan areas: A UTAUT2 perspective with social media marketing and consumer engagement,"As the metaverse emerges as a transformative digital realm, its adoption and integration into various aspects of society are subjects of increasing scholarly and practical interest. This research investigated the factors influencing the intention to use metaverse technology (IU) in Bangkok metropolitan areas, with a particular focus on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) framework, alongside the role of social media marketing (SMM) and consumer engagement (CE). To verify behavioral intention, gender, age, and experience are proposed as moderating factors affecting the constructs on individuals' behavioral intention of metaverse technology usage. The study collected data from 403 Thai internet users living in Bangkok and its surrounding areas using an online questionnaire. Subsequently, the PLS-SEM method was employed to validate the research model's robustness and reliability. Structural model analysis revealed significant relationships among constructs, highlighting SMM's direct influence on UTAUT2 (β = 0.787) and CE (β = 0.211). Serial mediation analyzes demonstrated a fully mediating role of SMM influencing UI through CE (β = 0.572) and UTAUT2 (β = 0.306). Moderation analyzes revealed the association between SMM and IU, mediated through UTAUT2 and CE, is moderated by age and experience. Additionally, the integration of PLS-SEM and artificial neural network (ANN) models underscored the accuracy and predictive power of the proposed framework. The findings of this study not only contribute to academic literature but also offer practical implications for marketers aiming to navigate the metaverse landscape effectively. They emphasize the pivotal role of UTAUT2 constructs and the subtle interplay between SMM, CE, and IU in shaping successful marketing strategies.

REC_00792,Privacy fatigue and its effects on ChatGPT acceptance among undergraduate students: is privacy dead?,"OpenAI's generative pre-trained transformer (ChatGPT) is rapidly transforming fields such as education and becoming an integral part of our daily lives. However, its rise has sparked intense privacy debates, raising concerns about the storage of personal information and attracting global regulatory scrutiny. ChatGPT is gaining popularity among undergraduate students owing to its personalized learning capabilities, leading many universities to provide guidelines and seminars on its use. Curiosity about the reasons for ChatGPT's popularity inspired our research. Through a survey of 695 undergraduate students in South Korea, we found that privacy fatigue-a feeling of hopelessness and weariness regarding privacy-was associated with these students' adoption of ChatGPT. The findings revealed that this fatigue reduces perceived privacy risks, enhances their expectations of the platform, and boosts their intention to use ChatGPT. By incorporating the concepts of privacy fatigue, perceived risk, and elements from the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, we developed a novel model to understand this phenomenon. Interestingly, despite the potential risks, the intention to use ChatGPT was not significantly influenced by perceived risk.

REC_00794,"AI matters, but my STEM sucks: Determinants of Chinese journalism students' views on greater AI training in journalism courses","As artificial intelligence (AI) makes inroads into all aspects of work, the need for training in the use of AI should be self-evident. Often, however, education institutions lag in incorporating these new skills into the curriculum. Drawing on previous research, this paper develops a bespoke model to investigate how three groups of factors - intrinsic factors such as subjective perceptions, extrinsic factors such as social influence, and personal characteristics such as individual innovativeness - affect Chinese journalism students' interest in seeing training in the use of AI incorporated in their university courses. In total, seven factors were identified as factors commonly attributed to interest in adoption of new systems and hypotheses were developed and tested in respect of each of these by way of a structural equation model using data collected from questionnaires distributed to journalism students. The key findings indicate that perceived usefulness and perceived ease play crucial positive roles in students' interest in having AI education incorporated in journalism education, while perceived value, individual innovativeness and social influence also played positive, but less important, roles. Two factors, cost and risk, played a negligible role in influencing students in favor of or against the incorporation of AI training into their curriculum. While the study examined factors impacting on students' views regarding the incorporation into their studies of one type of technological innovation, AI, the results may provide broader insights into the role of various factors more generally as motivators or inhibitors of student acceptance of training in new technologies in their studies.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.45,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00796,Generative artificial intelligence attitude analysis of undergraduate students and their precise improvement strategies: A differential analysis of multifactorial influences,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has fundamentally transformed the education landscape, offering unprecedented potential for personalized learning and enhanced teaching methods. This research conducted two sub-studies aimed at exploring the influences and differences in college students' attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence across the dimensions of gender, major, and experience. The first sub-study developed a scale based on the Expectancy-Value Theory to measure college students' attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence, confirming the scale's validity and reliability. The second sub-study analyzed attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence among 713 undergraduate students. The results revealed significant differences in undergraduate students' attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence based on gender, major, and experience. Female students and those with experience in generative artificial intelligence showed more positive attitudes compared to male students and those without generative artificial intelligence experience. Notably, students majoring in Education scored significantly higher on generative artificial intelligence attitudes than students from other majors. Regression analysis further indicated that gender, discipline, and experience significantly predicted attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence. Students from different academic backgrounds exhibited significant gender and experience differences in their attitudes towards generative artificial intelligence within their respective majors. These findings underscore the necessity for educational strategies that consider gender, experience, and disciplinary backgrounds. It is crucial to provide all students with ample opportunities to engage with generative artificial intelligence to ensure gender equity in artificial intelligence education.

REC_10621,Predicting adherence to gamified cognitive training using early phase game performance data: Towards a just-in-time adherence promotion strategy,"Background and objectives: This study aims to develop a machine learning-based approach to predict adherence to gamified cognitive training using a variety of baseline measures (demographic, attitudinal, and cognitive abilities) as well as game performance data. We aimed to: (1) identify the cognitive games with the strongest adherence prediction and their key performance indicators; (2) compare baseline characteristics and game performance indicators for adherence prediction, and (3) test ensemble models that use baseline characteristics and game performance data to predict adherence over ten weeks. Research design and method: Using machine learning algorithms including logistic regression, ridge regression, support vector machines, classification trees, and random forests, we predicted adherence from weeks 3 to 12. Predictors included game performance metrics in the first two weeks and baseline measures. These models’ robustness and generalizability were tested through five-fold cross-validation. Results: The findings indicated that game performance measures were superior to baseline characteristics in predicting adherence. Notably, the games “Supply Run,” “Ante Up,” and “Sentry Duty” emerged as significant adherence predictors. Key performance indicators included the highest level achieved, total game sessions played, and overall gameplay proportion. A notable finding was the negative correlation between initial high achievement levels and sustained adherence, suggesting that maintaining a balanced difficulty level is crucial for long-term engagement. Conversely, a positive correlation between the number of sessions played and adherence highlighted the importance of early active involvement. Discussion and implications: The insights from this research inform just-in-time strategies to promote adherence to cognitive training programs, catering to the needs and abilities of the aging population. It also underscores the potential of tailored, gamified interventions to foster long-term adherence to cognitive training.

REC_00798,"Beyond acceptance: an empirical investigation of technological, ethical, social, and individual determinants of GenAI-supported learning in higher education","The rapid development of generative AI (GenAI), such as ChatGPT, has created both opportunities and challenges for its use in education. Some educators have expressed concern that such rapid report generation from AI may encourage cheating or hinder the development of critical thinking skills in students. Moving beyond mere acceptance, we propose an integrated model based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the norm activation model (NAM) to examine the technological, ethical, social, and individual determinants of learners' behavioral intentions to use GenAI-supported learning applications in higher education. A total of 336 actual user responses from college students in Taiwan were collected through an online survey, and structural equation modeling using LISREL 8.54 was used to test the proposed hypotheses derived from the TAM-NAM model. The results show that perceived usefulness, ease of use, and enjoyment (technological factors) significantly influence college students' intention to engage in GenAI-supported learning applications, confirming findings of technological importance from the literature. Awareness of consequences positively influences personal norms (ethical factors) but negatively influences behavioral intentions; however, personal norms and subjective norms (social factors) are not found to be significant. This finding adds evidence to the academic integrity literature and reflects how college students consider ethical issues when using GenAI for learning. In addition, we found that personal innovativeness and self-efficacy are significant individual factors for college students' adoption of GenAI-supported learning applications. Based on the proposed TAM-NAM model, the results highlight the importance of considering technological benefits alongside ethical considerations and individual motivations.

REC_15150,ANALYSIS ON THE ACCEPTANCE OF AIGC TECHNOLOGY BY ART AND DESIGN STUDENTS IN UNIVERSITIES IN CHINA,"This study investigates the factors influencing the attitudes, behaviors and intentions toward the adoption of Artificial Intelligence Generated Content (AIGC) technology, among art and design students at Chinese universities. The conceptual framework is grounded in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), and economic consumption theory. Data were collected from 434 art and design students with AIGC experience at a university in Henan, China. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was utilized for analysis. The findings show that Perceived Benefit, Perceived Usefulness, and Social Influence, are necessary conditions, positively affecting students’ attitudes towards AIGC. Perceived Benefit, Attitude, Social Influence, Hedonic Motivation, and Facilitating Conditions, were found to be necessary conditions for behavioral intentions, positively influencing students’ behavioral intentions to adopt AIGC. Social Influence showed significance, but the necessity was not strong. Perceived Risk held neither significance nor necessity. Therefore, promoting AIGC adoption in Chinese art and design programs should focus on resource allocation and perception creation. © (2024), (Assumption University).

REC_10631,Adoption of AI writing tools among academic researchers: A Theory of Reasoned Action approach,"This research explores the determinants affecting academic researchers' acceptance of AI writing tools using the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA). The impact of attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived barriers on researchers' intentions to adopt these technologies is examined through a cross-sectional survey of 150 researchers. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) is employed to evaluate the measurement and structural models. Findings confirm the positive influence of favorable attitudes and subjective norms on intentions to use AI writing tools. Interestingly, perceived barriers did not significantly impact attitudes or intentions, suggesting that in the academic context, potential benefits may outweigh perceived obstacles to AI writing tool adoption. Contrarily, perceived barriers do not significantly affect attitudes and intentions directly. The TRA model demonstrates considerable explanatory and predictive capabilities, indicating its effectiveness in understanding AI writing tool adoption among researchers. The study's diverse sample across various disciplines and career stages provides insights that may be generalizable to similar academic contexts, though further research with larger samples is needed to confirm broader applicability. Results offer practical guidance for tool developers, academic institutions, and publishers aiming to foster responsible and efficient AI writing tool use in academia. Findings suggest strategies such as demonstrating clear productivity gains, establishing AI Writing Tool programs, and developing comprehensive training initiatives could promote responsible adoption. Strategies focusing on cultivating positive attitudes, leveraging social influence, and addressing perceived barriers could be particularly effective in promoting adoption. This pioneering study investigates researchers' acceptance of AI writing tools using a technology acceptance model, contributing to the understanding of technology adoption in professional contexts and highlighting the importance of field-specific factors in examining adoption intentions and behaviors.

To analyze educators' attitudes towards AI tools in Bangladesh, this research built a modified model that included components from the technology acceptance model (TAM), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT), and DeLone models. The study's purpose was to assess faculty attitudes towards AI adoption by analysing system quality information quality, facilitating condition, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and behavioural intention. An online survey was administered to 543 faculty members from private universities in Bangladesh using a cluster and multi-stage sampling technique. The results were analysed using structural equation modelling and complemented by in-depth interviews with 20 educators. The statistically significant model ( p < 0.05) explained 37.4% of the variation in educator's attitudes towards AI. The findings indicated that performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and information quality all had a favourable influence on attitudes, whereas behavioural intention had a negligible negative effect. The research, which uses the DeLone model in a novel way, concludes that information quality had a negligible positive influence on the attitude of educators. In contrast, system quality was not a significant determinant.

REC_13606,Enhancing Critical Writing Through AI Feedback: A Randomized Control Study,"This study investigates the effectiveness of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) systems on undergraduate writing development through a randomized controlled trial with 259 Chinese students. Despite promising applications of AI in educational settings, empirical evidence regarding its comparative effectiveness in writing instruction remains limited. Using a four-week intervention comparing Qwen-powered AI feedback to traditional instructor feedback, we employed difference-in-differences (DiD) analysis and structural equation modeling to examine how technology acceptance factors influence writing outcomes. Results demonstrated significant improvements in the AIGC intervention group compared to controls (beta = 0.149, p < 0.001), with particularly strong effects on organization (beta = 0.311, p < 0.001) and content development (beta = 0.191, p < 0.001). Path analysis revealed that perceived usefulness fully mediated the relationship between perceived ease of use and attitudes toward the system (beta = 0.326, p < 0.001), with attitudes strongly predicting behavioral engagement (beta = 0.431, p < 0.001). Contrary to traditional technology acceptance models, perceived ease of use showed no direct effect on attitudes, suggesting that students prioritize functional benefits over interface simplicity in educational technology contexts. These findings contribute to an expanded technology acceptance model for educational settings while providing evidence-based guidelines for implementing AI writing assistants in higher education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15188,Relationship between teachers' digital competencies and the acceptance and use of Artificial Intelligence during initial teacher training.,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming education, yet its adoption in teacher training still faces challenges. This study examines the relationship between pre-service teachers' digital competencies and their willingness to use AI in teaching. A quantitative ex post facto design was employed, surveying 793 students from Early Childhood and Primary Education programs at Andalusian universities. The DigCompEdu and UTAUT2 frameworks were used to assess digital competencies and technology acceptance, applying structural equation models to identify correlations. Results indicate that, among all analyzed digital competencies, only knowledge of the teaching-learning process significantly influences AI acceptance and use, while other dimensions, such as assessment, professional commitment, and the development of students' digital skills, do not have a significant impact. The study found that the lack of specific training limits the pedagogical use of AI, despite familiarity with these tools. Findings suggest the need to integrate training programs that strengthen pre-service teachers' digital and techno-critical competencies. Although this study provides empirical evidence on the importance of AI training, it has limitations related to sample size and methodological approach. Future research could expand the analyzed population and incorporate qualitative methodologies for a deeper understanding of the phenomenon. The study concludes that strengthening teacher training in AI would not only facilitate its adoption but also optimize its impact on learning, promoting a more ethical and effective use of these technologies in education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00135,Are College Students Ready to Learn AI?-A Readiness Perspective,"As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly integrated into education and the modern workforce, understanding what drives students to learn AI is essential. This study investigates the factors influencing college students' intention to learn AI, focusing on the roles of AI learning readiness (ALR), career readiness, AI literacy (AIL), intrinsic motivation, and extrinsic motivation. Data were collected from 313 Vietnamese college students and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that ALR, career readiness, and AIL significantly enhance both intrinsic and extrinsic learning motivation. In turn, both types of motivation positively influence AI learning intention (ALI). AIL also directly predicts ALI and exerts the strongest total effect among all predictors. The model demonstrates high explanatory power, with R 2 values exceeding 0.84 for all endogenous constructs. These findings contribute to the growing body of AI education research by highlighting the importance of readiness and literacy in shaping learning behavior. Practical implications extend beyond curriculum design to include career development initiatives and policy strategies that equip students with the competence, preparedness, and sustained motivation required to thrive in an AI-driven labor market.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Participants were enrolled in multiple teacher-preparation programs within a single U.S. higher education institution. Through a structured GenAI-integrated activity using Khanmigo, a domain-specific AI platform for K-12 education, PTs explored AI-supported instructional tasks. Post-activity data were analyzed using PLS-SEM. The results showed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease-of-use (PEU), and self-efficacy (SE) significantly predicted behavioral intention (BI) to adopt GenAI, with SE also influencing both PU and PEU. Conversely, personal innovativeness in IT and perceived cyber risk showed insignificant effects on BI or PU. The findings underscored the evolving dynamics of TAM constructs in GenAI contexts and highlighted the need to reconceptualize ease-of-use and risk within AI-mediated environments. Practically, the study emphasized the importance of preparing PTs not only to operate AI tools but also to critically interpret and co-design them. These insights inform both theoretical models and teacher education strategies, supporting the ethical and pedagogically meaningful integration of GenAI in K-12 education.

REC_14553,Healthcare Students' Attitude toward Robotic Surgery: A Cross-sectional Survey,"Introduction:Modern robotic surgery is practiced worldwide due to its advantages, including short hospital stay, reduced complications, and good cosmetic results. However, several limitations remain, including high costs, large instrument sizes, and provider ignorance. In Saudi Arabia, where the first robotic surgery was performed in 2003, the awareness of practice is limited. The paper intends to survey Saudi healthcare students' perception of robotic surgery to make industry improvements.Methods:A cross-sectional online survey was conducted from March to April 2024 that was distributed across regions targeting Saudi healthcare students. The questionnaire, through Google forms and social media, recorded the sociodemographic characteristics, knowledge, and awareness of robotic surgery. This employed a nonprobability convenient sampling technique, where the sample size in this study was 396 participants, calculated using the OpenEpi online sample size calculator. The ethical approval was obtained, and participants gave their informed consent.Results:Out of the 396 participants, 47% did not have any robotic surgery background and 63% did not know about robotic surgery centers in Saudi Arabia. However, 54.55% were willing to accept it for themselves and 43.43% believed patients in Saudi would be willing. Furthermore, 40.40% agreed that Saudi Arabia should invest in expanding robotic surgeries. The majority of the students acquired their information from the Internet (66.1%) and medical colleges (31.2%). There were significant differences in attitudes toward robotic surgery related to future fields of interest and tech-savviness.Conclusion:The study found positive attitudes among Saudi healthcare students regarding robotic surgery, yet with gaps in formal education and awareness. Comprehensive modules for robotic surgery must therefore be integrated into healthcare training programs to prepare students for new technological developments. Such a deficiency in education and rise in investments could together improve the adoption and effectiveness of this technology in the healthcare system of Saudi Arabia.

REC_15202,The Impacts of Students’ Acceptance of ChatGPT on Their Academic Self-Efficacy in a Personalized Learning Environment,"Literature on educational technology has highlighted the roles of AI in personalizing students’ learning and the relationship between learners’ acceptance of technology use and their academic self-efficacy beliefs, both of which contribute to enhancing academic achievement. ChatGPT, a generative language model recently developed by OpenAI, offers opportunities and poses challenges for education. However, limited research has examined how students use ChatGPT to support their personalized learning and the impact of their acceptance of ChatGPT on students’ academic self-efficacy. This study investigated Vietnamese undergraduates’ use of ChatGPT for their personalized learning. It examined the effects of their acceptance of ChatGPT on their academic self-efficacy at a private university in Vietnam. Results from the surveys and interviews indicated that students used ChatGPT to explain and summarize information, answer questions, provide feedback, create texts, and write code. Furthermore, students’ perceived usefulness of ChatGPT did not directly affect their academic self-efficacy. Instead, students’ perceived ease of use and usefulness of ChatGPT indirectly affected students’ academic self-efficacy through students’ attitudes toward ChatGPT. These results suggest improving students’ attitudes is critical for strengthening students’ academic self-efficacy in ChatGPTmediated learning. The study recommends providing structured guidance on using ChatGPT effectively and ethically, which aligns with Vietnam’s 2025 framework of digital competence for learners. © 2025, School of Liberal Arts, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.

The validated questionnaire comprised five sections assessed participants’ demographic details, knowledge, attitudes, perspectives, and views on integrating AI into the dental curriculum. Descriptive statistics and Fisher’s exact tests were used to evaluate the associations across clinical years. Results: A total of 144 responses were received. Most students rated their AI understanding as moderate, with the most recognized applications being image analysis (81.7%) and implant positioning and planning (69.3%). Majority acknowledged AI’s ability to accelerate processes, reduce the errors (79.1%), and provide vast real-time data (71.9%) as key clinical advantages. Majority of students supported AI in dentistry (88.6%–93.8%) and believed it enhances clinical efficiency (P < 0.05). Majority were open to integrating AI into practice, and many disagreed that AI could replace dentists. Most (93.2%–97.9%) recognized adoption challenges, primarily due to inadequate knowledge (71.2%) and limited AI access (69.9%), while cost was the least reported obstacle (1.4%). Opinions on AI’s impact on traditional roles were statistically significant (P < 0.05). Majority of the participants (82.7%–95.5%) supported AI integration into dental education. Conclusion: Clinical-year dental students acknowledged AI’s potential and expressed willingness to integrate it into future practice and dental education. However, addressing knowledge gaps and accessibility challenges will be crucial for its successful adoption in dentistry. © 2025 Journal of Datta Meghe Institute of Medical Sciences University.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15203,"Integrating Generative AI in EFL Academic Writing: Thai English-Major Students’ Purposes, Perceptions, and Experiences with ChatGPT","The rapid proliferation of generative AI, particularly ChatGPT, is fundamentally transforming EFL academic writing. Although AI-mediated writing has been widely researched, empirical studies within the Thai higher education context remain limited. To address this gap, the present mixed-methods study conceptualizes ChatGPT not only as software but also through the lens of Sociocultural Theory (SCT) as a mediated tool that can provide cognitive scaffolding. The study examined the purposes, perceptions, and experiences of 50 Thai senior English-major undergraduates who used ChatGPT as a writing assistant. The data from structured questionnaires and scenario-based interviews indicate that students primarily use the tool for self-regulation, specifically for paraphrasing, idea generation, and coherence enhancement. However, their adoption is discerning rather than uncritical. Participants valued the tool’s accessibility but remained cautious about ethical concerns, particularly plagiarism and the reliability of information. Importantly, despite AI’s efficiency, human feedback remains the essential form of “other-regulation” necessary for developing advanced writing proficiency. These findings suggest that educators should aim for a pedagogical balance that integrates technological resources with human guidance, offering clear implications for curriculum design and academic integrity in an AI-mediated era. © 2025, School of Liberal Arts, King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi.

REC_00808,Factors influencing Chinese pre-service teachers' adoption of generative AI in teaching: an empirical study based on UTAUT2 and PLS-SEM,"Although Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) has demonstrated significant potential in education, there is a lack of research on pre-service teachers' behavioral intentions toward GAI. This study is based on the UTAUT2 model and, for the first time, introduces perceived risk as a key variable to systematically investigate the factors influencing Chinese pre-service teachers' behavioral intentions and future usage of GAI in teaching. The innovation of this study lies in its analysis of the unique needs of pre-service teachers across disciplines, which reveals critical factors in technology acceptance. These findings offer new theoretical insights and practical guidance for the effective application of GAI in K-12 education. The study involved 563 pre-service teachers from three renowned teacher training universities in China. Data were collected using an online questionnaire platform and analysed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The results indicated that effort expectancy, social influence, hedonic motivation, and habit significantly enhanced pre-service teachers' behavioural intention to use GAI in future teaching. At the same time, perceived risk had a negative effect. In addition, performance expectaancy, facilitating conditions, and price value did not significantly influence behavioural intentions, but behavioural intentions and facilitating conditions had significant predictive effects on future use. Based on the findings, this study provides practical recommendations for optimising the user experience of GAI tools, enhancing technical support, and reducing perceived risk.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

To achieve the study purpose, data were collected from 1025 accounting students in Jordanian higher education institutions and analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). The results showed that perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, COVID-19 concerns, and protection motivation significantly influence ChatGPT usage. The results also indicated that ChatGPT usage and peer influence significantly influence continuance intention to use ChatGPT. Furthermore, the study found that peer influence accuracy moderates most indirect relationships, while results demonstrated that peer influence does not moderate the relationship between the perceived ease of use and ChatGPT usage, and hence hypothesis 6a was rejected.

REC_13618,Effect of GenAI Dependency on University Students' Academic Achievement: The Mediating Role of Self-Efficacy and Moderating Role of Perceived Teacher Caring,"Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) holds significant potential to enhance university students' learning. However, over-reliance on it to complete academic tasks poses a risk to academic achievement by potentially encouraging cognitive outsourcing. Despite this growing concern and an expanding body of research on GenAI usage, the mechanisms through which GenAI dependency and perceived teacher caring affect their academic achievement and self-efficacy remain underexplored. Based on the theory of media system dependence, this study explores the mechanisms through which university students' dependency on GenAI affects their academic outcomes, focusing on the mediating role of self-efficacy and moderating role of perceived teacher caring. A survey was conducted with 418 university students from Chinese public universities who had used GenAI for an extended period. The results revealed that GenAI dependency positively predicts false self-efficacy and negatively predicts academic achievement, exhibiting a significant Dunning-Kruger effect. Perceived teacher caring moderates the relationship between GenAI dependency and self-efficacy. High perceived teacher caring mitigates the Dunning-Kruger effect but has a weak moderating effect on academic achievement. These findings enhance the explanatory power of the media system dependency theory in educational contexts and reveal the pathways through which GenAI dependency and teacher caring affect learning processes and outcomes. This study expands the theoretical implications of teacher caring in the digital age and provides empirical evidence to aid higher education administrators in optimising AI governance and teachers in improving instructional interventions.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

This study examines how well AI works for orthodontic treatment planning and how dentists perceive it. An international validated questionnaire survey was distributed to dental professionals. Aim: The aim of the study was to evaluate the efficiency of AI in orthodontic treatment planning and its acceptance by dental practitioners. Materials and Methods: a cross-sectional survey was done on orthodontic practitioners, residents, and interested undergraduate students from the Orthodontic Division, Department of Preventive Dentistry, Faculty of Dentistry, Taif University, Taif, Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire was used to collect data bout the participants' use of AI in orthodontic diagnosis and treatment planning. Results and Discussion: The survey showed that 92% of dental professionals were generally aware of AI and its use in orthodontics. In addition to noting AI's potential for precise data, 84% of the participants stressed the value of human expertise in thorough orthodontic analyses. Furthermore, most of the respondents (80%) thought that AI could not completely replace orthodontists. Conclusion: AI is a useful diagnostic tool that improves dental professionals' knowledge in the planning of orthodontic treatments. It is not, however, a replacement for the expertise of experienced specialists in providing precise diagnoses and treatment plans. More research is needed to maximize AI applications and ensure their smooth integration into orthodontic practices. © 2024 Saudi Journal of Oral Sciences.",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.41,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

It also examined whether these perceptions varied according to gender and age group. Using a descriptive-correlational design, data were gathered from 392 teacher education students enrolled in a state-managed university in southwestern Mindanao. The results revealed that the respondents generally demonstrated moderate acceptance, favorable attitudes, and positive perceptions of AI effectiveness in the teaching and learning process. While no statistically significant differences were found between genders, moderate effect sizes suggested subtle variations worth further exploration. Significant differences were observed across age groups, with older individuals reporting higher levels of AI acceptance. Strong and significant correlations among acceptance, attitude, and perceived effectiveness affirmed the interconnected nature of belief, emotion, and evaluation in shaping readiness for AI integration. These findings support the Technology Acceptance Model and the Theory of Planned Behavior. In light of these results, it is recommended that teacher education programs integrate AI literacy and practical training, with targeted support for younger students to enhance digital confidence and preparedness. © 2025; Los autores.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Survey data from 1006 students across various majors and regions are analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. Notably, AI literacy (i.e., students' AI ethics, evaluation, and awareness) positively affect their attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control, although the influence patterns vary according to the literacy dimension. Perceived privacy risks reduce AI trust, which mediates adoption behavior. Overall, core TPB pathways are validated, with behavioral intentions significantly predicting students' actual use. Gender and regional differences moderate the key relationships.

REC_00322,An empirical study on anthropomorphism and engagement with disembodied AIs and consumers' re‐use behavior,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into the human race has gradually become a norm. AI entails technology assemblages such as machine learning, natural language processing, and reasoning. The influence of AI systems has intensified in consumers' daily lives. Many consumers have interacted with the notions of AI through advertisements or having personal experiences. Many consumers are curious about the use of AI. This paper reports three studies conducted to determine whether anthropomorphism (ANTH) and engagement play a role in consumers' intention to re‐use a voice assistant (VA; a machine‐learning AI). The second study will determine if ANTH and engagement play a role when consumers are using the VAs for different activities (task completion vs. information gathering). In addition, in Study 2, actual re‐use behavior was also tested in the model, which encouraged a stronger overall model fit. The results show that in general effort expectation (EE) has a strong positive impact on consumers' usage experience of the VA. However, between the two types of activities, EE has a stronger impact on consumers' usage experience for information‐gathering activities, whereas performance expectation has a stronger impact on usage experience when consumers use the VA for task‐completion purposes. The third study used internet usage experience as a moderating variable to determine the boundaries of the mediating effects in the study. The results show that the mediators yield results similar to prior studies.

REC_10721,User Willingness to Use Generative Artificial Intelligence Based on AIDUA Framework; 基于 AIDUA 框架的生成式人工智能使用意愿研究,"[Purpose/Significance] Generative artificial intelligence (AI) technology has been widely used in many fields, and the application of this technology has become popular among researchers. However, there are few studies on the willingness of researchers willingness to accept generative AI. This leads to an insufficient understanding of the psychological mechanism, cognitive process and behavioral pattern of users' acceptance of generative AI, which limits the ability of theoretical innovation and practical exploration in user information behavior. This study focuses on researchers acceptance of generative AI. By studying the evaluation process of ChatGPT by college students, it explores the acceptance behavior of generative AI. At the same time, it verifies the applicability of the AIDUA model in the new context, and introduces the new variable of school identity, which further extends the AIDUA model. [Method/Process] Based on the cognitive assessment theory and the AI acceptance framework (AIDUA), this paper constructs a theoretical model of the intention to use generative artificial intelligence, and develops and empirically tests the theoretical model of the intention to use generative AI. Taking college students as the main research object, based on the maturity scale in authoritative literature at home and abroad, 8 variables and 29 observation variables such as social influence, hedonic motivation and anthropomorphism were designed. College students with experience in using generative AI were invited to participate in the questionnaire survey. SPSS26.0 was used to analyze the data from 294 valid questionnaires collected. SmartPLS 3.2.9 was used to construct a structural equation model to test the hypothesis, and the JN method was used to detect the regulatory effect. [Results/Conclusions] The study found that users went through three stages of decision making before using generative AI. The PLS-SEM results show that: 1) Social influence, hedonic motivation and anthropomorphism significantly affect performance expectancy and effort expectancy, and anthropomorphism is the strongest variable affecting performance expectancy and effort expectancy. 2) Performance expectancy and effort expectancy are significantly negatively correlated with negative emotions, while hedonic motivation has no significant effect on negative emotions. 3) Negative emotions are significantly negatively correlated with users' intension to use. 4) School identity moderates the relationship between effort expectancy and negative emotions. This study combines anthropomorphic research on college students' acceptance of generative AI, and provides a framework for the acceptance of generative AI. Researchers can use this framework to better study the acceptance of AI. This study has some limitations. In the future, we will focus on the following three aspects: 1) to evaluate the users' acceptance of generative AI in different usage scenarios. 2) to use samples of other groups to test the applicability of the model, such as civil servants, librarians, researchers and other groups. 3) to incorporate variables from other technology acceptance models into the model, such as ease of use and practicality. © 2024 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

A questionnaire-based survey was conducted among 357 business students from public universities in China. The results reveal that generative AI adoption exerts a double-edged effect: it enhances sustainable entrepreneurial intentions by strengthening sustainable entrepreneurial self-efficacy through a promotion-focused pathway, while simultaneously undermining such intentions by heightening sustainable entrepreneurial fear of failure via a prevention-focused pathway. Moreover, artificial intelligence literacy moderates these relationships, amplifying the positive influence of generative AI adoption on entrepreneurial self-efficacy and attenuating its negative effect on fear of failure. This study enhances understanding of sustainable entrepreneurship amid the rise in generative AI, extends regulatory focus theory, and informs the development of AI-integrated sustainability education in academic institutions.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00818,Students' behavioural intention to use content generative AI for learning and research: A UTAUT theoretical perspective,"Generative Artificial Intelligence tools have the potential to impact students learning significantly and positively in several ways. However, the factors responsible for student's behavioural intentions to use these tools are still not fully understood, especially in the context of Nigerian higher education institutions (HEIs). To support students use of Content Generative - Artificial Intelligence (CG-AI) tools for learning and research purposes, it is important that HEI administrators and policy makers understand these factors. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to examine the factors that influence Nigerian students' behavioural intentions to use CG-AI tools for learning and research. Based on structural equation modelling technique, this study uses the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT) to examine the relationship between six constructs and students' behavioural intentions to use CG-AI. Employing a paper-based survey, responses from 289 students in the Department of Computer Science were obtained from a State University in northern Nigeria. A two-step approach (Confirmatory Factor Analysis and Path Analysis) was used to analyse the relationships between both observed and latent variables. The findings showed that three of the factors, performance expectancy (alpha = 0.551, p < 0.001), effort expectancy (alpha = 0.466, p < 0.001), and social influence (alpha = 0.507, p < 0.001) were observed to be determinants of behavioural intentions to use CG-AI tools. Facilitating conditions, perceived risks, and attitude towards technology, on the other hand, showed no significant impact on students' behavioural intention to use CG-AI tools.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10722,Continuance Intention to Use AI Chatbots in Libraries: Mediation Based on Emotional Experience; 图书馆 AI 聊天机器人持续使用意愿研究——基于情感体验的中介,"[Purpose/Significance] In the era of digital intelligence, robots technology is playing an increasingly important role in the field of education. The applying of AI chatbots in library scenarios is an important lever for the future construction of learning ecosystems in universities. This study aims to explain the influencing factors of users' willingness to continue using library AI chatbots, and provide a new perspective beyond the IT perspective to understand the impact of the basic characteristics of AI chatbots on human behavioral intentions, in order to better understand the sustainability thinking of interpreters and provide some inspiration for the further development of library AI chatbots in the future learning ecosystem.[Method/Process] Based on U&G theory and the SOR framework, we developed a conceptual model of library AI chatbot users's willingness to continue using the chatbot. Data were collected using a questionnaire survey method, with teachers and students as the main respondents. The variables of the AI chatbot user's continuous usage intention model were set to 8, each consisting of 3-6 options, and then measured using a 7-point Likert scale. Finally, the variables and hypotheses in the model were validated using a mixed research method of PLS-SEM and fsQCA. [Results/ Conclusions] The research results indicate that three types of satisfaction, hedonic (entertainment and avoidance), social (social presence), and utilitarian (convenience and information consultation), have a significant positive impact on emotional experience (awe experience and emotional participation), with avoidance having the greatest impact on awe experience and social presence having the greatest impact on emotional participation. Emotional experience has a significant positive impact on the intention to continue using, with awe experience having the greatest impact on the intention to continue using. Emotional experience, as a mechanism of action, affects user satisfaction and willingness to use. Based on the data analysis, four suggestions are proposed from the perspective of future learning ecology design and user psychology. When designing library AI chatbots, the usage scenarios should be enriched, and the healing function, immersive experiences and immersive experiences should be emphasized. The limitation of this study is that the use of first-hand cross-sectional data cannot prove whether the influencing mechanism changes over time. In the future, a combination of first-hand and second-hand data can be used to improve the explanatory power. In addition, although this study ensures the validity and reliability of cross-sectional data, there may be geographic and cultural differences in users' behavioral intentions. In the future, a comparative study of the intention to continue using library AI chatbots in different regions and levels can be considered. © 2024 Agricultural Information Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences.

This study addresses this gap by examining patterns of adoption, perceived usefulness, and the ambivalent experiences that arise when engaging with AI tools for academic learning. A questionnaire combining closed and open-ended questions was administered to 170 engineering students from a Chilean public university. A mixed-methods design was used to analyse the data: quantitative analyses identified adoption patterns and perceived usefulness, while qualitative thematic analysis captured emerging emotional, ethical, and motivational tensions. The results showed high adoption (73.5%), driven by the pragmatic usefulness of saving time, understanding concepts, and improving work. Although the overall perception was positive, a deep ambivalence was identified, with enthusiasm and confidence coexisting with ethical (plagiarism), cognitive (dependence), and technical (reliability) concerns. It is concluded that the effective integration of AI transcends technological access and requires an institutional strategy that promotes critical digital literacy, clear policies, and support programmes that address competency and gender gaps, ensuring ethical and equitable adoption that enhances learning without compromising the development of critical thinking.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: 2026-02-18T17:33:25.816995Z ERROR codex_core::rollout::list: state db missing rollout path for thread 019c71cf-5a64-7bc3-9c71-b36c09815e3c

The findings indicate that students only have a 70% success rate in identifying AIGC, and the recognition rate for domain-specific AIGC content may be even worse, with only 60%. Finding also indicated that perceived technological acceptance is the primary factor influencing AIGC credibility and behavioral adoption. Students may also experience AI illusions during AIGC usage, leading to overreliance. This research provides reliable evidence for assessing AIGC credibility in higher education, enhancing students' cognition and application abilities regarding AIGC, and offering insights into promoting effective use of AIGC.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15240,Antecedents of Generative Artificial Intelligence Technology Adoption: Extended Innovation of Diffusion Model with Cultural Dimensions and Risks Perceptions,"As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technologies are taking the lead among the technological advancements around the world, societies are increasingly becoming interwoven with Generative AI (GAI) technologies in all aspects, including higher education (HE). This study’s main aim is to examine how individual-level cultural dimensions influence students’ adoption of GAI in learning, drawing on an extended Innovation of Diffusion Theory (IDT) model. It explores the impact of individual-level cultural dimensions (individualism/collectivism and uncertainty avoidance), IDT innovation factors (relative advantage, complexity, compatibility, observability, trialability), and individual factors (self-efficacy, perceived risk) on Saudi students’ perceptions of GAI adoption across several universities. Quantitative data were collected from 306 online survey and analyzed using CB-SEM. Results highlight the instrumental role of cultural dimensions, with individualism/collectivism and uncertainty avoidance negatively affecting GAI adoption. While complexity showed no significant impact, all other IDT variables positively influenced adoption. Furthermore, self-efficacy and perceived risk were found to be significant indicators of GAI use. The study emphasizes the cultural differences that shape technology adoption in collectivist societies that are moving toward individualism such as Saudi. It identifies limitations, provides useful insights, and suggests recommendations for future research on GAI uptake in culturally diverse HE contexts. © 2025, J. Ecohum.

REC_15241,Adoption of Artificial Intelligence Tools for English Language Learning Among Saudi EFL University Students: The Moderating Role of Faculty,"Purpose: This study explores the adoption of AI tools by Saudi EFL (English as a Foreign Language) learners using an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). The research integrates additional factors such as perceived knowledge, engagement, and motivation to understand their influence on Saudi EFL university students' acceptance of AI tools. Research Method: Employing a cross-sectional survey design, data were gathered from 472 EFL students at King Saud University using a simple random sampling technique. The data were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) via AMOS (Version 29) in two stages: the measurement model and the structural model. Findings: The measurement model confirmed the reliability and validity of the study's constructs. The structural model tested the hypothesized relationships, revealing that perceived knowledge, engagement, and motivation significantly affect the perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEoU) of AI tools among Saudi EFL learners. Both PU and PEoU were found to significantly influence students' behavioral intention to adopt AI tools for language learning. However, no moderating effect was found for faculty in the relationship between students’ perception (PU and PeoU) and their intention to adopt IA tools. Collectively, these external variables explained 35% of the variance in PU, 43% in PEoU, 65% in the intention to adopt AI, and 36% in the actual adoption of AI tools. Significance: This research represents a pioneering effort within the Saudi educational context. By extending the TAM model to include perceived knowledge, engagement, and motivation, the study provides valuable insights into factors that influence the adoption of AI tools in English language learning. These findings can guide educators, universities, and language centers in developing strategies to enhance AI tool adoption, thereby making language learning more accessible and effective for students. © 2025, Creative Publishing House.

Qualitative research method was adopted to collect data. A preliminary survey of 102 university libraries in English speaking countries in Africa was conducted to identify the university libraries that have adopted AI in their libraries. Content analysis was used to analyse the responses. The study found that the only few university libraries in Africa have adopted AI technologies such as Chatbot, ChatGPT, LibKey from ThirdIron, robots, RFID technology and Grammarly. These AI technologies are used to render different library services like answering of directional and ready reference questions posed by library users, serving as a knowledge base for cataloguing information of library materials, self-check-out machine for books, used as a marketing tool for the library, tool for statistics evaluation and recommendations, assisting in the charging and discharging of library materials, etc. Lack of funds to acquire the AI tools, training of librarians, and lack of full knowledge of AI were the most mentioned challenges associated with adoption of AI in the libraries. The study recommended a formulation of policy to guide the adoption of new technologies such as AI, and training and retraining of librarians through workshops equip librarians with skills needed to effectively use the AI technologies.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00397,Can adopt ai‐powered educational technology buffer against academic stress and school burnout? A protective model proposal,"This study examined the relationship between trust in AI‐powered educational technology (AI‐EdTech) and school burnout among Turkish high school students and the mediating role of perceived usefulness and academic stress in this relationship. A total of 619 students (Mage = 15.95, SD = 0.94) participated in the study, and structural equation modeling was used. In the tested model, trust in AI‐EdTech was found to directly and negatively affect school burnout. However, perceived usefulness and academic stress were not significant mediators. In contrast, the serial mediation mechanism was found to be substantial, i.e., significant relationships were found between trust in AI‐EdTech and perceived usefulness and between academic stress and school burnout. These results suggest that students' confidence in AI‐EdTech systems leads them to perceive these systems as more practical and thus may reduce burnout through reduced academic stress. However, the inability of perceived usefulness or academic stress to mediate alone suggests that these two variables are effective when they work together. The results indicate that for AI‐EdTech to be used efficiently in education, strategies to increase student's confidence and practices that emphasize the usefulness of the systems and reduce academic stress should be developed.

Using structural equation modeling (SEM) on data collected from 490 participants, the research investigates: (a) the extent to which UTAUT2 constructs explain educators' intentions and behaviors toward AI adoption, (b) potential deviations from traditional UTAUT2 pathways, and (c) demographic differences in adoption patterns. The findings reveal a Price-Value paradox, where perceived value drives intention but practical barriers reduce actual usage, alongside deviations from traditional UTAUT2 pathways, highlighting the nuanced complexity of AI adoption in educational settings. This research underscores the importance of robust infrastructure, practical training in AI fundamentals, and sustained peer support in bridging the gap between intention and usage. Key drivers such as performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, and social influence play critical roles in shaping educators' adoption behaviors. By validating and extending the UTAUT2 model, the study provides actionable recommendations for policymakers and educators.

REC_00823,An investigation of college students' acceptance of AI-assisted reading tools: An expansion of the TAM and SDT,"Reading provides college students with vital assistance in their efforts to expand their knowledge base. Artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted reading tools have been developed with the aim of improving students' reading efficiency and reading experience. However, the acceptance of such tools and relevant influencing factors remain unknown. This study investigated the factors influencing college students' acceptance of AI-assisted reading tools. An integrative framework consisting of eight variables-perceived social presence (PSE), trust (TR), reading anxiety (RA), perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), perceived competence (PC), perceived autonomy (PA), and behavioral intention (BI)-was constructed with the aim of exploring the effects of these factors on intention to use in this context. The relationships among these variables were analyzed via structural equation modeling (SEM; n = 303). The results indicated that PEOU significantly enhanced college students' behavioral intentions to use AI-assisted reading tools, whereas RA had a significant negative effect on BI. Additionally, an investigation of the relevant mediating paths verified the indirect effects of PSE, TR, PC, and PA on BI. Level of education (undergraduate vs. graduate) had moderating effects on some of these variables. This study provides practical guidance for efforts to use artificial intelligence to facilitate learning among college students; furthermore, this guidance can be generalized by optimizing tool design on the basis of key factors such as RA.

This study assessed veterinary students' perceptions about ChatGPT in education and practice. It compared perceptions about ChatGPT between students who had completed a critical analysis task and those who had not.MethodsThis cross-sectional study surveyed 498 Doctor of Veterinary Medicine (DVM) students at The University of Sydney, Australia. Second-year DVM students researched a veterinary pathogen and then completed a critical analysis of ChatGPT (version 3.5) output for the same pathogen. A survey based on the Technology Acceptance Model was then delivered to all DVM students from all years of the programme, collecting data using Likert-style, categorical and free-text items.ResultsOver 75% of the 100 respondents reported having used ChatGPT. The students found ChatGPT's output relevant and practical for their use but perceived it as inaccurate. They perceived ChatGPT output to be more useful for veterinary students than for pet owners or veterinarians. Those who had completed the critical analysis assignment had a more positive view of ChatGPT's practicality for veterinary students but noted its authoritative tone even when delivering inaccurate information. Over 50% of the students agreed that information about tools such as ChatGPT should be included in the veterinary curriculum. Students agreed that veterinarians should embrace AI but disagreed that AI would eventually replace the need for veterinarians.ConclusionsA critical appraisal of outputs from AI tools such as ChatGPT may help prepare future veterinarians for the effective use of these tools.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14681,AI and Academia: Navigating the Adoption of Artificial Intelligence in Universities,"This study investigated the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI) platforms in Bangladeshi higher education institutions, with an emphasis on determining which AI platforms are most widely used and assessing the variables that affect AI adoption. The particular criteria influencing platform preferences and the comparative analysis of various types of institutions remain unclear despite the abundance of research on AI adoption. The study employed logistic regression analysis to test two primary hypotheses: (1) private universities had a higher level of AI adoption compared to public universities, and (2) better technological infrastructure was positively associated with higher AI adoption levels. Data was collected through a structured survey administered to a representative sample of 100 participants from various higher education institutions, capturing information on AI adoption levels, institutional type, technological infrastructure, technical expertise, and financial constraints. The analysis revealed that the most widely adopted AI platforms were ChatGPT, followed by AWS, Google Cloud Platform, and Google Gemini. The logistic regression results supported the hypotheses, indicating that private universities were more likely to adopt AI at higher levels compared to public institutions. Additionally, better technological infrastructure was associated with higher AI adoption levels. The confusion matrix demonstrated that while the model performed well in predicting AI adoption levels, there were some misclassifications, particularly between high and medium adoption categories. © 2025, Ayse Sahin Ozturk.

REC_07551,Examining the Factors Influencing the Mobile Learning Usage During COVID-19 Pandemic: An Integrated SEM-ANN Method,"The way in which the emotion of fear affects the technology adoption of students and teachers amid the COVID-19 pandemic is examined in this study. Mobile Learning (ML) has been used in the study as an educational social platform at both public and private higher-education institutes. The key hypotheses of this study are based on how COVID-19 has influenced the incorporation of mobile learning (ML) as the pandemic brings about an increase in different kinds of fear. The major kinds of fear that students and teachers/instructors are facing at this time include: fear because of complete lockdown, fear of experiencing education collapse and fear of having to give up social relationships. The proposed model was evaluated by developing a questionnaire survey which was distributed among 280 students at Zayed University, on the Abu Dhabi Campus, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with the purpose of collecting data from them. This study uses a new hybrid analysis approach that combines SEM and deep learning-based artificial neural networks (ANN). The importance-performance map analysis is also used in this study to determine the significance and performance of every factor. Both ANN and IPMA research showed that Attitude (ATD) are the most important predictor of intention to use mobile learning. According to the empirical findings, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm played a strongly significant role justified the continuous Mobile Learning usage. It was found that perceived fear and expectation confirmation were significant factors in predicting intention to use mobile learning. Our study showed that the use of mobile learning (ML) in the field of education, amid the coronavirus pandemic, offered a potential outcome for teaching and learning; however, this impact may be reduced by the fear of losing friends, a stressful family environment and fear of future results in school. Therefore, during the pandemic, it is important to examine students appropriately so as to enable them to handle the situation emotionally. The proposed model has theoretically given enough details as to what influences the intention to use ML from the viewpoint of internet service variables on an individual basis. In practice, the findings would allow higher education decision formers and experts to decide which factors should be prioritized over others and plan their policies appropriately. This study examines the competence of the deep ANN model in deciding non-linear relationships among the variables in the theoretical model, methodologically.",2021,WoS; Scopus; IEEE,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01793,"Artificial Intelligence Tools Usage: A Structural Equation Modeling of Undergraduates’ Technological Readiness, Self-Efficacy and Attitudes","This study investigates the relationship between undergraduates’ technological readiness, self-efficacy, attitude, and usage of artificial intelligence (AI) tools. The study leverages the technology acceptance model (TAM) to explore the relationships among the study’s variables. The study’s participants are 176 undergraduate students from a public university in southwestern Nigeria. The Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to analyze the responses from the participants. The questionnaire has six constructs measured on a 5-point Likert scale. The results show that undergraduates’ technological self-efficacy determines their usage of AI tools and perception of AI tools’ ease of use, but this does not determine their perception of the AI tools’ usefulness and attitude towards AI tools usage. Also, technological readiness was found to determine the perception of the AI tools’ usefulness, perception of AI tools’ ease of use, and technological self-efficacy among undergraduates but does not determine their usage of AI tools and attitude towards AI tools usage. In addition, undergraduates’ attitude towards AI tools was considered the primary determinant of the usage of AI tools. It was concluded that some factors determine the adoption of AI tools, which are interrelated. Educators can play a pivotal role in empowering students to harness the power of AI tools by encouraging their usage under well-coordinated guidance rather than imposing outright restrictions.

REC_12356,UNLOCKING EDUCATIONAL POTENTIAL: EXPLORING STUDENTS’ SATISFACTION AND SUSTAINABLE ENGAGEMENT WITH CHATGPT USING THE ECM MODEL,"Aim/Purpose The main goal of this study is to investigate the factors affecting students’ satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT in an educational context, using the Expectation-Confirmation Model (ECM) as the theoretical framework. Specifically, this investigation focuses on identifying how user expectations, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction influence the continuous usage of ChatGPT in education. Background ChatGPT is an AI-based chatbot that can generate natural language and support multi-turn dialogue. ChatGPT can be used in education for various purposes, such as academic writing, language translating, coding assistance, and information searching. Research indicates that ChatGPT is highly beneficial for students. Specifically, it aids in time-saving by synthesizing information across diverse fields and offers feedback tailored to individual learning needs and progress. Moreover, it enhances learning experiences through a personalized learning process, as well as aids in the translation of learning materials into different languages for improved accessibility. Despite the potential of ChatGPT in education, there remains a gap in understanding the determinants of user satisfaction and continuous usage. Therefore, this study was conducted to bridge this gap by assessing the impact of expectation confirmation, perceived usefulness, and satisfaction on continuous usage of ChatGPT. Methodology This research employed a quantitative approach, which utilized a five-point Likert scale questionnaire to measure four variables with a total of 14 items. Data were collected from 435 students from eight Vietnamese universities through non-probability convenience sampling. The internal consistency of the questionnaire was examined using Cronbach’s alpha. Four-factors Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) and Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) were then employed through IBM SPSS 26 and AMOS 24 to assess the proposed model and hypotheses, allowing for a comprehensive examination of the relationships between 4 variables: perceived usefulness, expectation confirmation, satisfaction, and continuous usage. Contribution This paper contributes to the literature on ChatGPT in education by identifying how expectation confirmation and perceived usefulness affect students’ satisfaction and their intention to continue using ChatGPT in their learning. This study also has practical implications for educators and students for applying ChatGPT in their learning and teaching. It provides recommendations for effective use of ChatGPT in education. Findings The study’s results show that students with greater expectations, either met or surpassed by ChatGPT, perceived the tool as more beneficial and satisfying for their needs. Additionally, students who perceived ChatGPT as useful and valuable for their learning goals were more inclined to continue to use it. Furthermore, the findings indicate that higher satisfaction with the tool was associated with a greater likelihood of continuous usage. Nevertheless, the results did not reveal a significant relationship between perceived usefulness and satisfaction regarding ChatGPT. This implies that perceiving ChatGPT as useful does not guarantee satisfaction. This finding may be attributed to various factors influencing student satisfaction, such as price value, using habit, facilitating conditions, trust, reliability, and quality. Recommendations Educators and students should consider the findings of this study to make in-for Practitioners formed decisions about the use of ChatGPT in educational settings, emphasizing the importance of managing users’ expectation confirmation and ensuring perceived usefulness and satisfaction on continuous usage. Recommendations Researchers can use the findings of this study as a foundation for exploring a for Researchers deeper understanding of user expectation confirmation and the factors influencing perceived usefulness and satisfaction with ChatGPT in diverse educational settings. Impact on Society This study contributes to the broader field of the application of AI technologies in education, potentially reshaping the dynamics of interaction between students and educators with AI technologies for educational purposes. Its contributions have the potential to elevate the overall quality of education by promoting the appropriate and effective use of AI technologies. Future Research Future research should investigate the roles of ChatGPT in education more deeply and explore its long-term effects on both learners and educators. This includes conducting comparative studies to evaluate the efficacy and advantages of ChatGPT-assisted learning in comparison to traditional teaching methods. Additionally, there is a crucial need to assess the broader impact of ChatGPT on students’ academic performance, cognitive development, and critical thinking skills.

REC_01797,"Perspectives of teachers on the employ of educational artificial intelligence tools in education: The case of the gaza strip, palestine","This study is aimed at investigating teachers’ perspectives on the use of EAITs in education. This study uses a mixed-method cross-sectional design, including a quantitative study and a qualitative study, targeting Palestinian teachers in the academic year 2022–2023. In the quantitative section, we recruited a convenience sample of 264 teachers from schools from November 20, 2022, to June 30, 2023. We gathered data by using an online, well-structured, and self-administered survey with 35 items. The survey tool was composed of seven sections: (A) demographic information, (B) constructivist pedagogical beliefs (CPB), (C) transmissive pedagogical beliefs (TPB), (D) perceived trust (PT), (E) perceived usefulness (PU), (F) perceived ease of use (PEU), and (G) behavioral intention (BI). In the qualitative section, 15 teachers were interviewed in focus group discussions by two trained researchers. Descriptive statistics and an inductive content analysis approach were used to analyze quantitative and qualitative data, respectively. The results showed that the median value of the total CPB scores was very high (4.40, IQR = 4.2–4.8) and TPB was low (2.40, IQR = 2.00–3.05). In addition, the median value of the total PT (3.50, IQR = 3.00–4.00), PU (4.00, IQR = 3.75–4.5), PEU (3.50, IQR = 3.00–4.00), and BI (4.00, IQR = 3.67–4.33) scores was high. Males had a significantly higher median score of PT when compared to females (4.00 versus 3.50, respectively; p = 0.033). Teachers aged 22–30 were the highest in the median score of PT as compared to their other counterparts (3.75; p = 0.037). Also, teachers who employ technology in education and those who attend courses related to AI in education had a significantly higher median score of PT, PU, PEU, and BI than teachers who did not employ various technologies in education. Also, teachers who work in private schools had the highest median score of PEU as compared to their counterparts (4.00; p = 0.014). Teachers who have scientific backgrounds had a significantly higher median score of BI than teachers who have art backgrounds (4.00 versus 3.99, respectively; p = 0.009). More detailed research is needed on the impact of employing EAITs on school students and teachers in education.

REC_09189,Exploring the Variation Between Lecturers’ and Students’ Attitude Towards Leveraging Generative Artificial Intelligence Systems in Foreign Language Teaching and Learning,"Artificial intelligence has brought an expansive revolution in the education systems. As such, it has become necessary to explore the views of university lecturers in foreign language education about their attitude, acceptance, and conduct toward leveraging and integrating generative artificial intelligence models (GenAI) in foreign language teaching. Also, it is pertinent to analyze the perception and attitude of foreign language students towards using GenAI to enhance their foreign language learning experience. The current study investigated the difference in the opinions of lecturers and students on the use of GenAI systems in teaching and learning a foreign language. The sample involved 177 lecturers and 493 postgraduate students in foreign languages. The study adopted a quantitative descriptive design using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model as the theoretical framework. Data were collected through a structured questionnaire assessing four key constructs: (Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Social Influence, and Facilitating Conditions). Independent-samples t-tests were conducted to examine group differences, and reliability was confirmed through Cronbach's alpha values above 0.80 for all constructs. The results revealed significant differences between lecturers and students across all UTAUT dimensions, with students demonstrating more positive perceptions and higher acceptance levels of GenAI tools in language learning. These findings suggest a generational and experiential gap in technology adoption, highlighting the need for targeted professional development programs to enhance lecturers’ digital readiness and pedagogical integration of AI technologies. The study recommends institutional policies that support training, resource access, and awareness initiatives to ensure equitable and effective implementation of GenAI in higher education. © The Author(s) 2025",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12358,"UNDERSTANDING UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' ADOPTION OF CHATGPT: I NSIGHTS FROM TAM, SDT, AND BEYOND","Aim/Purpose The aim of this study is to explore the factors that influence higher education students' adoption of ChatGPT by incorporating constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Self-Determination Theory (SDT) with trust, social influence, and personal innovativeness. Background Even though the use of ChatGPT has become more popular among university students, there is no clear evidence about the reasons that would make them adopt or abstain from using such a tool. Methodology The study utilized a survey that was answered by 150 university students registered in the faculty of engineering at a public university. The survey was developed by Google Forms and focused on how useful and easy they think ChatGPT is, their motivations, trust, social influence, innovativeness, and their readiness to use it. Statistical analysis was performed using SPSS 26 and SmartPLS4, with the latter being particularly useful due to the study's complex model and adherence to sample size criteria. Contribution This research provides fresh insights into how students perceive and start using modern AI tools like ChatGPT. It also helps educators and policymakers understand how to integrate AI technologies into education better to make learning more effective. Findings The study reveals that students are more likely to adopt ChatGPT if they perceive it as useful and easy to use. External motivation and social influence significantly impact students' behavioral intentions to use ChatGPT, while trust also plays a crucial role. Intrinsic motivation, however, does not significantly affect behavioral intention. The strongest predictor of actual use is behavioral intention, indicating that students who intend to use ChatGPT are highly likely to do so. Personal innovativeness is another significant factor influencing both behavioral intention and actual use. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Educators and policymakers should focus on enhancing the perceived usefulness, ease of use, trust, social influence, and innovativeness related to ChatGPT to increase its adoption in educational settings. Future research should explore additional psychological and contextual factors that may influence the adoption of ChatGPT and other similar technologies among students. Impact on Society Understanding the factors that influence the adoption of ChatGPT can help in developing strategies to integrate such tools effectively in education, potentially improving learning outcomes and digital literacy among students. Future Research Further studies should examine the long-term effects of ChatGPT usage on students' learning outcomes and investigate the adoption patterns in different educational contexts and disciplines.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15668,An exploratory analysis of student perspectives on ChatGPT across disciplines,"Recent evolution in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) implementation technologies, such as ChatGPT, presents potential tradeoffs for students and educators. With the expanding use of ChatGPT, the issue of users’ trust and believability in generated responses has become crucial. To our best knowledge, there is no research that considers the users’ perspective on the veracity of AI systems’ generated outcomes. In this brief preliminary exploratory study, we aim to understand technology users’ reactions to AI generated responses. For this purpose, we administered a survey across academic disciplines of a heterogeneous university. We analyzed the data using one proportion hypothesis test. We demonstrate that though users possess great confidence in ChatGPT, they still verify the veracity of ChatGPT generated responses, showing that technology users need to become aware that AI applications are not infallible. We provide insights into the adoption, usage patterns, and nuanced perception of ChatGPT within the student population in the academic community. © 2025 Editorial Board English Scholarship Beyond Borders.

REC_03502,Are you ready? An investigation of factors affecting artificial intelligence readiness of college students,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) brings substantial convenience to individuals' daily lives and redefines the knowledge and skills college students need. Enhancing the AI readiness (AIR) of college students will help them adapt to the advent of the AI era as early as possible. Little is known about college students' AIR and it is unclear what factors influence college students' AIR. Inspired by the social cognitive theory, a theoretical framework, that is Environment - Cognition - AIR, is proposed to examine the factors affecting college students' AIR and uncover the mechanisms that underlie the effect of these factors on college students' AIR. Five hundred sixty-eight college students were recruited to participate in the questionnaire survey. The partial least square structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was used to validate the theoretical framework. The results show that the college environmental factors (i.e., social support, teaching condition, and teaching activity) influence college students' AIR through cognitive factors (i.e., perceived relevance and self-efficacy). Perceived relevance and self-efficacy are mediating variables. These findings push the boundaries of technology readiness and provide empirical evidence for improving college students' AIR and facilitating AI education in higher education institutions.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15671,UNIVERSITY STUDENTS' ACCEPTANCE OF CHATGPT AS A WRITING ASSISTANCE TOOL IN ESL AND ESP STUDIES,"This study aims to evaluate the perceptions and acceptance of artificial intelligence chatbot ChatGPT for completing writing assignments among ESL and ESP students at two universities in Lithuania and Ukraine. Technology acceptance is understood as users' willingness to employ certain information technologies for tasks they were designed to support. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), developed by Davis in 1986 and validated by Davis, Bagozzi and Warshaw in 1989, is one of the most frequently used frameworks for understanding how individuals get to accept new technologies. For decades, it has been employed to assess ESL and ESP students’ acceptance of all kinds of technologies used to train different language skills. However, there is insufficient empirical evidence regarding how they accept AI tools, such as ChatGPT. This study tries to address the existing research gap. It employs a quantitative method and a questionnaire based on the TAM to assess various factors influencing acceptance of ChatGPT as a writing assistance tool among ESL and ESP learners within a non-mandatory use context. The outcomes are expected to contribute to the understanding of adopting artificial intelligence tools in educational settings and provide insights for integrating them into ESL and ESP curricula effectively. © 2025 Ovidius University.

REC_03505,Research on multimodal based learning evaluation method in smart classroom,"In traditional learning contexts, teachers primarily assess students' behavior, emotional changes, and assignment completion to ensure teaching quality. Currently, there are challenges in evaluating students, such as assessments being insufficiently comprehensive and timely, a singular evaluation perspective that hinders the holistic consideration of factors affecting learning assessments, and a weak correlation among evaluation criteria, resulting in suboptimal evaluation outcomes. In recent years, with the rapid development and widespread application of artificial intelligence and information technology, the era of smart classrooms has arrived. New technologies like image processing and artificial intelligence offer opportunities for personalized support services and enhancing teaching quality. Therefore, to provide a more comprehensive and objective reflection of teaching quality, this paper proposes a multi-modal information fusion learning assessment model. This model is achieved by determining the weight values of three dimensions, cognitive attention, emotional attitude, and course acceptance along with their corresponding attributes. Subsequently, through a fusion strategy, it calculates the learning assessment score by integrating information from these three dimensions. A series of experimental data confirms the effectiveness of this approach.

REC_12362,EXPLORING HIGHER EDUCATION FACULTY INSIGHTS ON GENERATIVE AI IN CREATIVE COURSES,"Aim/Purpose This study examined the understudied perceptions of higher education instructors on the use of art-based AI generators in digital art, design, and creative-based courses and answered the research questions: (1) how disruptions by generative artificial intelligence (GenAIs) are impacting teaching, and (2) what are the major factors that contribute to a healthy digital art ecosystem in higher education. Background While GenAI has attracted widespread public attention, there is insufficient research on integrating art-based AI generators in digital art and design classrooms. Concurrently, there is a demand for collecting and integrating faculty and educators' perspectives, which are key stakeholders in preparing future art and design professionals for the GenAI-driven workforce. Our study is presented against such a backdrop. Methodology The study incorporated a mixed-method approach to analyze survey data collected from higher education faculty on their perception of text-to-image generators. Quantitative data was analyzed through statistical analysis, and qualitative data was analyzed through a blend of human-AI thematic analysis. Contribution The study provides empirical data on higher education faculty's perspectives regarding the implications of art-based AI generators through survey and mixed-method analysis, serving as a baseline for further research and the development of AI literacy interventions. Additionally, the research identifies effective peda-gogical strategies and best practices for embedding generative AI into teaching and learning, contributing to the field of education. Findings Art-based GenAIs create both positive disruptions (e.g., improved ideation, problem-solving, and creative processes) and negative disruptions (e.g., ethical implications, technical limitations, and pedagogical concerns) in higher educa-tion. Insufficient AI literacy and inadequate resources among faculty signifi-cantly set back the effective adoption of GenAIs in classrooms. Ethical issues, including academic integrity, copyright, and bias, emerge as prominent issues re-quiring the implementation of responsible AI frameworks and policies. Adopt-ing pedagogical strategies, such as action-based learning, experimental learning, and active learning, can help optimize student engagement and enhance learning outcomes. Last but not least, a healthy digital art ecosystem in higher education hinges on responsible AI use and standards, continuous technological improve-ment, effective educational support, a human-centered approach, and a strong sense of community and collaboration. Recommendations for Practitioners The paper recommends increasing AI literacy among faculty through profes-sional development programs and collaborative learning initiatives; developing and implementing responsible AI use policies, guidelines, and frameworks to address ethical concerns and ensure the effective and ethical use of GenAIs in classrooms; and integrating pedagogical strategies such as action-based learning, experimental learning, and active learning to enhance student engagement and learning outcomes with GenAIs. Recommendations for Researchers The paper recommends conducting further research on the integration of art-based generative AI in digital art and design classrooms across all academic lev-els; further exploring faculty and educators' perspectives on GenAI use to de-velop best practices and frameworks for effective and ethical adoption in higher education; and investigating the long-term impacts of GenAI technologies on teaching and learning in art, design, and creative-integrated disciplines through longitudinal studies. Impact on Society The larger implications of the paper's findings include promoting awareness and education on the ethical implications, benefits, and limitations of GenAIs to foster responsible use and acceptance; encouraging interdisciplinary collabora-tion to address the challenges and opportunities presented by GenAIs in the creative and cultural industries; and supporting the development of a healthy digital art ecosystem that balances human creativity with technological advance-ments, ensuring inclusivity, accessibility, and sustainability. Future Research Based on drawbacks that emerged from the study, such as the sampling method and the sample size, future research should focus on targeting larger and more diverse samples from across different regions of the United States, as well as in-tegrating objective measures to complement self-reported data. As this research is focused on text-to-image generators, future research should expand to addi-tional GenAI types and models to deepen our understanding of their potential benefits and use impacts. Additionally, future research would benefit from stud-ying the long-term impacts of GenAIs on education and the development of human-centered solutions and interventions tailored for faculty and students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02356,Investigating factors of students' behavioral intentions to adopt chatbot technologies in higher education: Perspective from expanded diffusion theory of innovation,"With the emergence of emerging 4IR technologies, AI application tools (chatbots) are becoming more and more popular and widespread in various fields, including education. This study investigates the factors that influence undergraduate students' inclination to utilize AI application tools, specifically chatbots, for educational purposes. We applied an expanded diffusion theory of innovation framework to examine the relationships between relative advantages, compatibility, trialability, trust, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. Data from 842 undergraduate students were collected through a questionnaire using a 7-point scale, and the findings were analyzed using SmartPLS 4.0.9.2 software with a covariance-based structural equation model. The results confirm the hypotheses regarding the relative advantages, compatibility, trialability, perceived usefulness, and trust of chatbots. Students who perceive the benefits of chatbots express a strong intention to use them for academic purposes. The perception of compatibility between students and chatbots positively influences their adoption intention, and those who have the opportunity to try out chatbots are more likely to use them, indicating the importance of trialability. Surprisingly, the study did not find direct relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention, suggesting the presence of other influencing factors or dynamics in the adoption of chatbots for educational purposes. The findings offer practical insights for students and contribute to the theoretical understanding of the diffusion theory of innovation. Future research can further explore these findings to gain deeper insights into the complexities of chatbot adoption and enhance the adoption of AI tools in educational settings.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The participants, 1079 Chinese college students (56.2 % female, 43.8 % male; mean age = 21.4), including undergraduates, graduates, and PhD students, came from various academic disciplines. The study examines how personalized AI feedback impacts students' motivation and academic performance. Data were collected via a questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS (version 27) and AMOS (version 24), employing descriptive statistics, correlation, regression analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) to investigate relationships among variables. The results reveal significant positive relationships between AI-driven personalized feedback and students' goal achievement, academic self-efficacy, and learning engagement. AI feedback enhances students' clarity of goals, boosts their confidence, and increases their involvement in learning by providing adaptive, personalized support. It fosters a sense of mastery and control, improving both goal achievement and self-efficacy, which subsequently enhances engagement. The study finds that AI-driven feedback is a strong predictor of these outcomes, with more personalized feedback leading to higher levels of motivation, engagement, and confidence.

REC_12363,"EXPLORING AI IN EDUCATION: PRESERVICE TEACHER PERSPECTIVES, USAGE, AND CONSIDERATIONS","Aim/Purpose This study investigated how undergraduate and graduate students in a teacher education program perceived, used, and ethically reflected upon generative AI tools. The problem is the unclear state of preservice teachers’ understanding and use of generative AI in educational settings, which this study aimed to ex-plain.Background Given generative AI’s growing presence in education, this study addressed a gap in understanding by examining preservice teachers’ perceptions, experiences, and ethical concerns, particularly in relation to self-regulated learning.Methodology A convergent parallel mixed-methods design was used to gather quantitative and qualitative data from 73 students enrolled in a teacher education program at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Descriptive statistics, correlations, and thematic analysis were used for data analysis.Contribution This study contributes to the emerging literature by providing insights into pre-service teachers’ usage patterns of generative AI, the relationship between AI use and self-regulatory skills, and a detailed examination of ethical concerns, in-forming effective AI integration into teacher education programs.Findings Text-based generative AI was the most familiar tool among participants. The primary reasons for the use included editing papers, searching for new ideas, and understanding course material. A significant positive correlation was identi-fied between information search with the help of generative AI and resource management skill. Key themes identified by thematic analysis included per-ceived benefits for student engagement and creativity, AI’s potential as a writing assistant, and ethical concerns about plagiarism and misuse. Overall, preservice teachers demonstrated surface-level use and a general lack of in-depth knowledge about AI integration.Recommendations for PractitionersTeacher educators should provide explicit training in generative AI, including practical guidelines and clear ethical frameworks to foster effective and respon-sible integration into classroom practice.Recommendations for ResearchersFuture researchers should develop validated measurement instruments specifi-cally designed for studying generative AI perceptions and usage and explore longitudinal impacts as preservice teachers transition into professional teaching roles.Impact on Society By guiding preservice teachers toward informed and ethical use of generative AI, this study supports broader societal goals of promoting digital literacy, ethi-cal technology integration, and enhanced learning experiences for future genera-tions.Future Research Subsequent research should further explore reasons behind the limited adoption of generative AI among preservice teachers, examine the long-term impacts of AI use on pedagogical practices, and investigate structured frameworks for pro-moting deeper AI integration within the teaching and learning domain.

REC_01824,Uncovering the drivers of intent to use the metaverse: diverse experiences in sustainability education,"This study investigates how technological and pedagogical factors influence students' intention to engage with virtual worlds on educational metaverse platforms and examines the resulting learning outcomes in sustainability education. Traditional sustainability education often fails to effectively engage students with real-world challenges. Metaverse platforms provide immersive, interactive environments that bridge theoretical knowledge with practical application but face usability, complexity, and user comfort issues that can hinder engagement and learning. Using a mixed-methods approach, 54 undergraduate students from Hong Kong and the Philippines participated in sustainability modules via the Classlet metaverse platform. Regression analysis revealed that Ease of Use, Enjoyment, Perceived Performance, and Immersion accounted for 77.1% of the variance in intent to engage. Ease of Use and Enjoyment were the strongest positive predictors, while higher Immersion negatively impacted VR users, indicating that excessive complexity reduces usability. Additionally, gaming experience influenced enjoyment, with weekly gamers reporting higher engagement. Desktop users showed the highest intent to use the platform, whereas VR users experienced greater immersion but also more discomfort. Qualitative feedback highlighted the platform's engaging and innovative features alongside technical and navigational challenges affecting learning outcomes. These findings highlight the need to balance interactivity, usability, and adaptability in educational technologies. Recommendations include implementing adaptive learning pathways, enhancing onboarding processes, and offering customizable interaction levels to accommodate diverse learner needs.

The purpose of the current study was to evaluate Chinese higher education students' intentions to adopt AI-based robots for educational purposes. Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) 3 model, the current study proposes 14 hypotheses to evaluate students' intention to adopt AI-based robots in education. The students' data were collected and analyzed using PLS-SEM. The study findings revealed that 12 hypotheses were accepted and two were rejected. The results indicate that students are willing to accept AI-based robots in their education. However, the findings revealed an insignificant influence of job relevance and robot anxiety on perceived usefulness and ease of use, respectively. The findings of this study will provide insight into university administrations regarding the significance of AI-based robots in education. Moreover, the findings will help robot developers, policymakers, and university administrators design and implement AI-based robots that fulfill contemporary education needs.",2023,WoS; Scopus; IEEE,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15688,"Assessment of Medical Students' Acceptance, Knowledge, Attitudes, and Readiness toward Artificial Intelligence","Background and purpose: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming numerous fields, particularly healthcare. In Iran, where AI is an emerging discipline, there is a notable gap in knowledge and understanding in this area. This study aimed to explore medical students' acceptance, knowledge, attitudes, and readiness regarding medical artificial intelligence. Materials and methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted on 117 medical students selected through convenience sampling. The study utilized a structured questionnaire comprising four sections: demographic characteristics, readiness (22 items rated on a five-point Likert scale), acceptance (28 items rated on a five-point Likert scale), knowledge (8 items rated on a three-point Likert scale), and attitude toward artificial intelligence (13 items rated on a five-point Likert scale). Data were analyzed using SPSS version 27, employing descriptive statistics, independent t-tests, Pearson correlation tests, and regression analysis. A significance level of P<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results: The findings indicated that the mean levels of readiness (50.66±84.13), knowledge (23.17±27.3), and acceptance (25.95±63.14) were moderate, while the mean attitude level (51.46±01.6) was good. A direct and statistically significant relationship was observed among readiness, knowledge, acceptance, and attitude toward artificial intelligence (P<0.05), except for the relationship between readiness and attitude, which was not statistically significant (P=0.516). Regression analysis showed that attending artificial intelligence training courses (Beta=22.5, P=0.013) and knowledge about artificial intelligence (Beta=0.41, P<0.001) were strong predictors of readiness for medical artificial intelligence. These relationships remained statistically significant in both simple and multivariate linear regression analyses. Additionally, artificial intelligence usage and acceptance were identified as independent predictors of readiness in simple linear regression. Conclusion: Medical students at Babol University of Medical Sciences showed a positive attitude toward artificial intelligence, indicating its growing relevance in medical education. These findings suggest that education planners should focus on improving students’ knowledge, readiness, and acceptance of AI through well-structured courses and training programs. Such efforts could help better prepare students for the increasing role of AI in healthcare. © 2024, Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

REC_07578,Examining IoT-Based Smart Campus Adoption Model: An Investigation Using Two-Stage Analysis Comprising Structural Equation Modelling and Artificial Neural Network,"The progress and evolution of technology have been rapidly transforming various aspects of our society and daily lives, including colleges and campuses into smarter environments compared to the past. Despite the numerous advantages offered by cutting-edge technologies, such as IoT-based smart campuses, academic research on their implementation suffers from a significant lack of comprehensive information necessary to deliver efficient smart campus solutions. Therefore, the focus of this study is to investigate the significance of IoT-based smart campus adoption from 14 proposed hypotheses. The researchers collected data from stakeholders affiliated with universities in Iraq, resulting in a dataset of 442 observations. To analyze the data, a two-stage approach was employed, consisting of structural equation modeling (SEM) and reevaluated with the artificial neural networks (ANN) method. The findings provide evidence supporting the significance of various constructs. In particular, the model demonstrates satisfactory predictive relevance, indicating its effectiveness in making accurate predictions or forecasts. The ANN analysis suggests that the model has predictive capabilities. Moreover, the study findings support the importance of perceived usefulness in technology-specific factors, facilitating conditions, and propagation in organizational-specific factors, government support, social influence, and external pressure in environmental-specific factors, as well as privacy concerns, self-efficacy, satisfaction, and domain-specific knowledge in end-user-specific factors. Four hypotheses related to perceived ease of use, service collaboration, habit, and innovativeness were rejected. Notably, the study identifies propagation as the most significant predictor in the ANN analysis.

REC_01826,Leveraging AI-driven insights to enhance sustainable human resource management performance: moderated mediation model: evidence from UAE higher education,"This study examines the impact of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven insights on sustainable Human Resource Management (HRM) performance in higher education institutions. It explores the mediating roles of HRM practices optimization and decision-making enhancement, as well as the moderating effects of organizational culture, AI adoption readiness, and ethical considerations. By incorporating innovative insights into artificial intelligence technologies, this research contributes to career and HRM literature by revealing how AI transforms workforce dynamics in academic institutions. Data was collected via a quantitative survey from 215 participants, including administrators, AI and data science experts, data analysts, human resource management professionals, institutional leaders, IT staff, and policymakers from higher education institutions in the UAE. Using non-probability quota sampling. Data analysis was conducted through descriptive statistics, t-tests, correlation analysis, and structural equation modeling (SEM) using Partial Least Squares SEM (PLS-SEM) in SmartPLS software. Findings confirm that AI-driven insights significantly enhance sustainable HRM performance. Both HRM practices optimization and decision-making enhancement mediate this relationship. While ethical considerations, organizational culture, and AI adoption readiness directly influence HRM sustainability, they do not significantly moderate AI's impact, suggesting that individual engagement with AI technologies plays a more pivotal role than broader organizational factors. This research uniquely integrates the Resource-Based View (RBV) and Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to examine AI adoption in HRM within higher education-an area previously underexplored. It underscores the importance of HRM optimization and decision-making in maximizing AI's benefits.

REC_03510,Understanding user stickiness in GAI-IDLE platforms: Insights from self-determination theory,"Amidst the accelerating progress of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the rise of GenAI-assisted informal digital English learning (GAI-IDLE) platforms has prompted growing scholarly interest in understanding the psychological mechanisms that drive sustained learner engagement. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this study investigates how GAI-IDLE fosters user stickiness among Chinese university students by focusing on the psychological needs that influence intrinsic motivation. The constructs of perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, control, and flow experience are interpreted within this motivational framework to reveal how learners' internal psychological states influence their long-term engagement with GenAI-integrated learning environments. Guided by SDT, a survey was conducted with 669 participants, and the data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) via Smart PLS 4.0. Empirical findings demonstrate that GAI-IDLE significantly promotes user stickiness through both direct and indirect pathways. Notably, control (beta = 0.440, p < 0.001) and flow experience (beta = 0.180, p < 0.001) emerged as strong mediators, underscoring the centrality of learner autonomy and immersive experiences in sustaining engagement. While perceived ease of use showed a moderate positive association, perceived usefulness did not exert a significant effect, suggesting that affective and experiential dimensions may be more critical than utilitarian perceptions in motivating continued use. The study highlights the need for GAI-IDLE platforms to foster intrinsic motivation and sustain meaningful engagement.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Analyses of a survey of U.S. college students (N = 947) show that SES has a greater association with AI literacy than with general digital literacy. Two dimensions of Chat GPT activities emerge: academic support and displacement. Structural equation modeling reveals that AI literacy is positively associated with both activity dimensions, while digital literacy is unexpectedly a negative contributor. Further, academic support is strongly linked to positive outcomes whereas academic displacement is negatively associated. Attitudinal trust in Chat GPT moderates the overall relationships. Our findings suggest that conventional digital inequality persists and evolves with generative AI, traditional digital literacy becomes insufficient in the age of AI, and trust in this new and opaque digital technology influences these relationships.",2026,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11177,Teaching Effectiveness and Deep Learning in EMI Business Courses: The Mediating Role of Academic Buoyancy,"Background: The rapid global expansion of English-Medium Instruction (EMI) has transformed higher education, particularly in business programs that require students to master complex disciplinary knowledge while overcoming language-related barriers. EMI students must simultaneouslyovercome linguistic, cognitive, and cultural barriers, which can increase academic stress, reduce participation, and negatively impact learning outcomes. Despite these challenges, most EMI research has relied on correlational models emphasizing self-efficacy, motivation, or language proficiency, while overlooking psychological constructs that capture students' abilityto manage daily academic stressors. Academic buoyancy-the capacity to persist through routine academic setbacks-offers a theoretically robust and practically relevant lens for understanding student adaptation in multilingual learning environments. Purpose: This study examines academic buoyancy as a mediating mechanism linking teaching effectiveness to deep learning outcomes in EMI business education. Drawing on academic resilience theory, interaction theory, and self-regulated learning theory, we investigated predictors of academic buoyancy and tested whether it mediates the relationship between teaching effectiveness and deep learning. Method: Data were collected via cross-sectional surveyfrom 215 international students enrolled in EMI business courses at a South Korean university. Multiple regression analysis identified predictors of academic buoyancy, and Hayes' PROCESS macro with 5,000 bootstrap samples tested mediation pathways. Results: Learner-professor interaction (beta = .163, p < .001), teaching effectiveness (beta = .146, p < .001), and cognitive engagement (beta = .102, p = .006) significantly predicted academic buoyancy, collectively explaining 30.6% of the variance. Mediation analysis demonstrated that academic buoyancy fully mediated the relationship between teaching effectiveness and deep learning (indirect effect = .071, p < .05; 95% CI [.012, .130]), with no significant direct effect (beta =-.023, p > .05). Notably, peer interactions, content engagement, and metacognitive self-regulation did not significantly predict academic buoyancy after controlling for other variables. Conclusion: Academic buoyancy served as a key psychological mechanism through which teaching effectiveness influences deep learning in EMI contexts. The findings suggest that effective EMI pedagogy operates primarily by fostering student resilience rather than through direct content transmission, with practical implications for faculty development emphasizing both relational and pedagogical dimensions of instruction.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.2,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12367,A STUDY OF CHINESE UNDERGRADUATE INTENTIONS TO PURCHASE AIGT EDUCATIONAL PRODUCTS: AN EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS BASED ON A MULTI-THEORETICAL MODEL,"Aim/Purpose This study aims to investigate the decision-making mechanisms underlying Chinese undergraduate students' purchase intentions toward artificial intelligence generation tools (AIGT) educational products by integrating three theoretical frameworks: the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), and the Value-based Adoption Model (VAM). Background With the popularization of AIGT in the education field, its acceptance and demand are becoming increasingly prominent. While AIGT demonstrates substantial potential in enhancing pedagogical outcomes and personalizing learning experiences, its market penetration, particularly in adoption rates among university student populations, remains contingent upon multifactorial determinants, which are of interest to our community of practice. Methodology This study integrates the TPB, the TAM, and the VAM to construct a theoretical framework for the purchase intention of AIGT education products. Thereafter, an online survey was conducted among 523 undergraduate students from different regions of China, and a structural equation model was used to analyze the obtained data. Contribution This study bridges theoretical gaps by integrating TPB, TAM, and VAM into a novel framework, offering a holistic understanding of the adoption of AIGT educational products and providing empirical evidence for understanding the purchase intention of undergraduates towards AIGT educational products. Findings The results show that while brand perception has no direct significant impact on purchase intention, the rest of the investigated factors all have significant impacts on purchase intention to varying degrees, and there are also strong correlations among the investigated factors. Among them, the perceived fee was the most critical factor with a significant negative impact. However, perceived usefulness could increase consumers' threshold regarding perceived fee, exerting a significant positive impact on it. Brand perception did not directly affect perceived value; it influenced the latter indirectly via the mediating variable of enjoyment. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Educational technology firms should prioritize enhancing product functionality and adopt tiered pricing strategies, while universities should integrate AIGT into curricula and foster industry partnerships to align products with pedagogical needs. Future studies should expand sampling to diverse populations, incorporate cultural or policy variables, and employ mixed-method methodologies to deepen insights into AIGT adoption dynamics. Impact on Society AIGT adoption could democratize access to personalized education and bridge learning gaps, but equitable pricing and ethical AI deployment are critical to prevent socioeconomic disparities. Future Research Validate the framework in cross-cultural contexts, investigate AI ethics and cultural adaptability, and assess long-term educational outcomes of AIGT integration through longitudinal studies.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15776,Adoptability of machine learning and its relationship to learning style preferences,"This research has empirically examined the association between the implementation of M-learning and the interests of Malaysian EFL students in a course in business English. The report used a systematic method for association analysis. The data were randomly collected from 125 Malaysian EFL students from a total of 184 cell phone students enrolled in an English business class at one of the universities in Shanghai, Malaysia. Two structured testing instruments, Mobile Learning Questionnaire (MLQ) and the Choice Questionnaire for Visual Learning Style (PLSPQ), were introduced. The findings revealed that students display a high degree of M-learning in business Language. It was found that the participants had a significant preference for visual learning, group learning, individual learning, tactile learning and auditory learning, while being the least concerned with kinesthetic learning. Tests of disparities showed that males respondents have a higher appeal for utility, acceptability, satisfaction, ease-of-use and behavioural intent than their peers, if students are divided by age and gender. Regarding their age, it was noted that respondents understood the benefits of using M-learning regardless of their age. Likewise, there are no major variations in the interests of respondents in their learning styles when clustered according to class. The younger group of respondents however shows preference for group study, while the older group favors individual schooling. Finally, a significant association between acceptance of M-learning and student expectations was demonstrated. The optimistic correction indicates that the higher the recognition of M-learning by students, the greater their expectations for touch, physical, visual, auditory, kinesthetic and touch learning activities.

REC_01830,Exploring barriers to AI course assistant adoption: a mixed-methods study on student non-utilization,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has demonstrated significant potential in enhancing learning experiences, yet many students choose to not engage with AI tools available within their courses. This mixed-methods exploratory study investigates the barriers to the adoption of Spark, the AI course assistant implemented at Los Angeles Pacific University (LAPU). Analyzing 602 student survey responses collected through End-of-Course (EOC) evaluations, this study investigates the reasons behind this non-utilization, utilizing combined sentiment analysis with thematic analysis. The findings reveal that perceived necessity, lack of familiarity, and minimal awareness of Spark are primary factors contributing to non-use, alongside external issues such as time constraints and preference for traditional study methods. Notably, the absence of negative sentiment suggests that resistance is not rooted in dissatisfaction with the tool itself, but in limited perceived value or awareness. The study highlights the critical role of communication strategies, faculty engagement, and integration of AI tools into coursework to improve adoption. Addressing these barriers through improved communication, faculty-led AI integration, and targeted training initiatives can significantly enhance student engagement and learning outcomes. Without intervention, non-utilization may limit students’ opportunity to build foundational AI literacy—an increasingly important competency in academic and professional environments shaped by AI technologies. These insights offer actionable guidance for educators and institutions seeking to maximize the benefits of AI powered learning tools, and foster AI literacy among students in the evolving technological landscape. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09370,Student adoption of e-learning at makerere university during COVID-19: A structural equation modelling based on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology,"The onset of COVID-19 dealt a severe blow to the education sector in Uganda, leading to the mandatory closure of all learning institutions to mitigate the spread of the virus. Makerere University, a venerable institution in the region, was not exempt from this directive. The initial uptake of e-learning was sluggish due to various factors, including inadequate infrastructure, digital illiteracy among both students and some faculty members, and, most notably, a lack of preparedness in utilizing digital eLearning technologies. The objective of this study was to examine the factors that impacted students’ embrace of eLearning at Makerere University during the COVID-19 pandemic. Employing a quantitative approach, the study utilized questionnaires structured based on the nine constructs of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology model. Between August and December 2021, a questionnaire was distributed to 374 students from two colleges. Structured equation modelling was employed to assess 16 factors that were hypothesized to have an impact on adoption. Effort expectancy emerged as the most robust predictor. Likewise, the behaviour of utilizing eLearning technologies was predominantly impacted by facilitating conditions. Utilizing the UTAUT methodology, this study’s theoretical significance arises from our effort to broaden the existing literature on the utilization of video conferencing software (Zoom) in conjunction with a learning management system (MUELE) during the challenging period of COVID-19, an area that has not been extensively explored. The results offer insights into the embrace and approval of both systems within the framework of a developing nation. This study delivers valuable perspectives for developers of eLearning systems, emphasizing the importance of creating user-friendly platforms that enhance the learner experience.

REC_07582,Toward an Interactive Reading Experience: Deep Learning Insights and Visual Narratives of Engagement and Emotion,"Engagement and emotion are critical components that significantly influence a reader’s experience during a reading task. Despite the crucial role of engagement and emotions in shaping our reading experience, accurately tracking these dynamic states during actual reading remains a significant challenge. This study bridges this gap by detecting engagement and emotion levels during a reading task by leveraging the power of state-of-the-art deep learning models and investigating the correlations between the engagement levels and emotions. An experiment was conducted involving 18 university students reading 14 documents followed by a questionnaire to rate their levels of engagement, valence, and arousal after reading each document. A Tobii 4C eye-tracker with a pro license along with an Empatica E4 wristband were utilized to record behavioral and physiological data from the participants. A range of deep learning models were utilized for computing the engagement, valence, and arousal values, employing both user-independent and user-dependent methods. Our investigation revealed distinct yet complementary strengths in two deep learning models: Transformer excelled in user-independent detection of engagement and emotion with an accuracy of 80.38% (engagement), 71.28% (arousal) and 73.98% (valence) while ResNet shined in the user-dependent setting with an accuracy of 93.56% (engagement), 90.62% (arousal) and 88.70% (valence) which highlights the interplay between individual differences and reading dynamics. Intriguingly, we observed strong, document-specific correlations between engagement and emotion states, suggesting that different texts evoke unique affective responses. We developed an interactive dashboard visualizing predicted engagement and emotions, offering real-time feedback and personalized learning possibilities. The dashboard features an engagement gauge that displays the reader’s level of engagement based on predicted class probabilities, and an emotion emoji serving as a visual cue that illustrates the predicted emotional state of the reader. This technology can inform the design of dynamic interfaces that adjust to individual reading styles and emotional responses, potentially enhancing comprehension and involvement.",2024,IEEE,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11185,Assessing the Empowering Efficacy and Perceived Pedagogical Prospects of ChatGPT in the Saudi Arabian Context: A Mixed Method Study,"Open AI's ChatGPT is getting a wider currency in educational institutions across the globe. It is immensely popular among learners and instructors due to its immense potential to generate different texts, answer questions, offer instant feedback, and be tailored to an individual's specific needs using advanced AI technology. However, the perspectives of EFL instructors on the efficacy of ChatGPT remain largely unexplored. Therefore, this study seeks to assess the potential of ChatGPT as an empowering tool and the perceived pedagogical prospects and educational opportunities in the specific context of Saudi Arabia. A questionnaire with self-designed items and partial adoption of modified items was sent to EFL instructors working in different universities in Saudi Arabia. While thematic analysis was used to analyze qualitative data, descriptive statistics was used to analyze quantitative data. The findings revealed that EFL instructors viewed ChatGPT as a potent resource for pedagogical opportunities and for delivering outstanding language instruction to their students. The study also found that ChatGPT contributed to instructors’ professional development and fostered collaborative learning and innovative teaching practices. Respondents also believed technology-powered instruction undermined traditional learning resources and hampered analytical and creative skills. The findings also revealed that technologically driven education was quite unlikely to replace human instructors though it caused stress and anxiety among language learners. The study holds immense pedagogical implications and offers educational opportunities. The findings will help language instructors and policymakers reinvent themselves and integrate digital technologies to empower language learners. © 2025 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The research aims to provide a clearer understanding of the psychological mechanisms that drive effective learning outcomes through technological features in the context of Vietnamese higher education. Background The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the digital education landscape, particularly with the emergence of AI-driven personalized learning systems. These platforms promise adaptive, learner-centered experiences by leveraging data-driven algorithms to tailor content, feedback, and support to individual needs. However, the success of such technologies is not solely dependent on their technical capabilities; it also hinges on students' psychological responses, including how they perceive the platform's value and trustworthiness. Despite growing implementation, a limited understanding remains of how multiple system characteristics, such as intelligence, personalization, anthropomorphism, and information quality, collectively shape these psychological factors and ultimately influence academic performance. Moreover, individual learner traits, such as self-efficacy, may determine how effectively students can translate positive perceptions into learning success. This study addresses these gaps by applying the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework, integrated with the Information System Success Model (ISSM), to explore the complex interplay between technological features, psychological responses, and learning outcomes in AI-driven education. The research is conducted within the Vietnamese higher education context, offering novel insights from an emerging educational market. Methodology This study employed a quantitative research design using a structured online questionnaire to collect data from university students in Vietnam who had experience with AI-powered personalized learning platforms. A non-probability convenience sampling method was employed, yielding 462 valid responses. The data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) with SmartPLS 3.0 to examine relationships among platform characteristics, perceived value, perceived trust, and learning performance, with self-efficacy as a moderating variable. Contribution This study advances the theoretical understanding of AI in education by integrating system design characteristics, including intelligence, personalization, anthropomorphism, system quality, and information quality, with psychological constructs such as perceived value and trust, under the S-O-R framework and the ISSM. It also introduces self-efficacy as a key moderating variable. The integration of these frameworks within the context of Vietnamese higher education provides new empirical evidence on how AI-enhanced platforms support learner performance in developing countries, contributing both to global and localized knowledge of technology-enhanced learning. Findings The findings reveal that intelligence, personalization, information quality, and system quality of AI-powered learning platforms significantly enhance both students' perceived value and trust, whereas anthropomorphic features only boost perceived value but do not directly influence perceived trust. Both perceived value and trust have a positive impact on student learning performance, with perceived value also strengthening perceived trust. Additionally, self-efficacy plays a moderating role, amplifying the effects of perceived value and trust on learning outcomes, suggesting that learners with higher self-efficacy benefit more from these platform features. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Developers should prioritize enhancing system intelligence, personalization, and information quality to foster student trust and perceived value. Educators and academic institutions should focus on strengthening students' self-efficacy through digital literacy training and personalized learning support to maximize learning outcomes. These findings provide concrete guidance for technology developers, educators, and policymakers seeking to design and implement effective AI-based learning solutions in higher education environments. Researchers should explore other psychological or contextual moderators, such as learning motivation and cognitive load, and validate the model across diverse educational environments and demographic groups to increase generalizability. Impact on Society By uncovering the mechanisms that drive effective learning in AI-supported environments, this study provides actionable guidance for creating more equitable, engaging, and high-quality digital education systems. The findings contribute to improving academic success, digital competency, and learner empowerment, thereby supporting the broader goal of technology-enabled inclusive education in developing contexts such as Vietnam. Future Research Future research could explore longitudinal effects of AI learning tools, incorporate behavioral data, and examine the interplay between affective responses and cognitive evaluations in AI-driven learning dynamics.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03513,AI-supported English public speaking in the Chinese EFL context: Insights from self-regulated learning and positive psychology,"Positive affective factors, including enjoyment, engagement and self-efficacy etc., have been established as correlates of enhanced academic performance. While both self-regulated learning (SRL) and artificial intelligence (AI) demonstrate individual merits in promoting cognitive and affective outcomes, their synergistic potential within English public speaking (EPS) remains inadequately investigated. Grounded in SRL theory, this study aims to develop and examine an AI-Supported Self-Regulated EPS (AI-SREPS) model, thereby addressing this gap. A total of 88 first-year undergraduate students participated in the study. Two experimental groups received training based on the AI-SREPS model, while the control group received instruction of equal duration that focused on general introductions to AI tools for English language learning but did not involve the AI-SREPS model. Data were collected at three time points: pre-test, post-test, and a six-week follow-up, including questionnaires and English speech performances. To examine the effects of the AI-SREPS model, a series of statistical analyses were performed on Chinese EFL learners' speech performance and positive affective factors, including a mixed-design repeated measures ANOVA, a Hierarchical Linear Model (HLM), and Bonferroni-adjusted post hoc comparisons with simple effect analyses. The results indicate that students in the AI-SREPS groups demonstrated significant improvements in speech content and language quality. They also reported higher emotional engagement, personal enjoyment, self-efficacy, and willingness to communicate (WTC). Nonetheless, challenges remained in fostering creativity in speech content, supporting behavioral delivery, and maintaining social support. This study makes contributions through the development of the AI-SREPS model, a longitudinal multi-group design that captures both immediate and sustained outcomes, and a multidimensional analysis cross-validating speech performance with questionnaire data. The results offer important implications for promoting the integrated development of cognitive, emotional, and social dimensions in EPS pedagogy.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09382,Medical students' intention to integrate digital health into their medical practice: A pre-peri COVID-19 survey study in Canada,"Objective We aimed to explore the factors that influence medical students' intention to integrate dHealth technologies in their practice and analyze the influence of the COVID-19 pandemic on their perceptions and intention. Methods We conducted a two-phased survey study at the University of Montreal's medical school in Canada. The study population consisted of 1367 medical students. The survey questionnaire was administered in two phases, that is, an initial survey (t(0)) in February 2020, before the Covid-19 pandemic, and a replication survey (t(1)) in January 2021, during the pandemic. Component-based structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to test seven research hypotheses. Results A total of 184 students responded to the survey at t(0) (13%), whereas 138 responded to the survey at t(1) (10%). Findings reveal that students, especially those who are in their preclinical years, had little occasion to experiment with dHealth technologies during their degree. This lack of exposure may explain why a vast majority felt that dHealth should be integrated into medical education. Most respondents declared an intention to integrate dHealth, including AI-based tools, into their future medical practice. One of the most salient differences observed between t(0) and t(1) brings telemedicine to the forefront of medical education. SEM results confirm the explanatory power of the proposed research model. Conclusions The present study unveils the specific dHealth technologies that could be integrated into existing medical curricula. Formal training would increase students' competencies with these technologies which, in turn, could ease their adoption and effective use in their practice.",2022,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11187,The Factors Influencing AI Adoption Willingness Among English Language Students in Jordanian Private Universities,"This study examined the factors influencing English language students' willingness to adopt artificial intelligence (AI) in Jordanian private universities. Three key factors were investigated, specifically ease of use, time and psychological risks associated with AI, and task–technology fit (TTF). The study hypothesized that these factors would have a significant positive impact on students’ AI adoption. A quantitative technique was utilized to collect data using a survey. The study sample consisted of 130 English language students. The findings revealed significant positive correlations between students’ willingness to use AI and perceived ease of use as well as perceived time and psychological risks. Contrary to expectations, TTF did not have a significant impact on students’ willingness to use AI.

REC_11188,Feedback Literacy and EFL Learner Engagement With ChatGPT Feedback: Predicting Feedback Uptake and Perceived Usefulness,"The proliferation of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT has transformed feedback provision in EFL writing, offering scalable and immediate support to learners. However, learner engagement with AI-generated feedback remains highly variable, raising questions about the internal mechanisms that shape feedback uptake. This study investigates how feedback literacy predicts both the behavioral adoption and perceived usefulness of ChatGPT-generated feedback among EFL learners, while also examining whether perceived ease of use mediates this relationship. Data were collected from 51 Chinese university students through questionnaires and revision-based tasks across three ChatGPT-supported writing assignments. Results from linear regression and bootstrapped mediation analyses revealed that feedback literacy significantly predicted both successful feedback uptake (R²=.56) and perceived usefulness (R²=.42). Moreover, perceived ease of use partially mediated this relationship, suggesting a layered cognitive-affective mechanism underlying learners’ engagement with algorithmic feedback. These findings extend feedback literacy theory beyond interpersonal contexts to AI-mediated, non-dialogic writing environments. They also refine the Technology Acceptance Model by highlighting learner competence as a critical determinant of usability and value perceptions. Pedagogically, the study underscores the need to cultivate feedback literacy as a prerequisite for meaningful engagement with AI tools in writing instruction. © 2025 ACADEMY PUBLICATION.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_15815,"Context-aware adaptive m-learning: Implicit indicators of learning performance, perceived usefulness, and willingness to use","Mobile learning tools can enable high-quality education on a large scale at low costs. However, these tools also suffer from low engagement, and they lack content personalization and adaptation. Therefore, research on meeting the diverse needs that are imposed by devices, users, usage contexts, and infrastructure variations are increasingly important. This pilot study investigates how learning performance is affected by perceived usefulness and the willingness of undergraduate students to use an adaptive m-learning tool that personalizes the learning materials’ format to the user and device contexts. An assessment was done using an implicit measure (dwell time), an explicit measure (satisfaction questionnaire), and a learning assessment (post-test). An experiment was conducted with convenient sample of 31 students; approximately half of the students used a traditional school e-learning system, and the other half used the context-aware adaptive learning tool. The study used implicit and explicit indicators to empirically validate a score-based model that calculates the scores for different learning material formats based on the user and device contexts. The results suggest that context-based adaptive mobile-learning tools can significantly improve the perceived usefulness of learning materials, as well as learners’ willingness to use the tools. Practical and theoretical implications were suggested for the design of context-aware adaptive mobile-learning tools to assess and enhance learners’ perceived usefulness and willingness to use learning materials. © 2019 American Society for Engineering Education.

REC_12372,"LINKING AI LITERACY, SELF-EFFICACY, ATTITUDES, AND ACHIEVEMENT: A MIXED-METHODS STUDY ON THE MODERATING ROLE OF AI USAGE AND STUDY YEAR","Aim/Purpose This study addresses a key gap in the AI in education literature by examining whether AI literacy, attitudes towards AI, and AI self-efficacy are related to academic achievement and whether their effects vary by duration of AI use and study year among undergraduates at an institution in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. Background The rapid growth of AI in higher education presents both opportunities and risks for student learning; however, empirical evidence on AI competencies and achievement remains limited, particularly in emerging contexts such as Vietnam. Drawing on Control-Value Theory, this study focuses on how students' perceived control (skills, self-efficacy) and value (attitudes) in using AI tools relate to their academic outcomes. Methodology This study employed a mixed-methods design that combined a cross-sectional survey of 376 undergraduates in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, with qualitative analysis of open-ended responses from eight students. Quantitative data were analyzed using Spearman correlations, ordinal logistic regression, and moderation tests, while qualitative data were examined through template analysis to explain how and why students use generative AI tools in their learning. Contribution The study integrates Control-Value Theory with AI-use competencies and tests two under-examined moderators (duration of AI use, years of study). It complements statistical results with qualitative insights that explain when and why AI competencies translate into achievement. Findings AI self-efficacy was the only significant predictor of a higher GPA category. AI literacy showed small positive correlations with GPA, whereas attitudes toward AI were not directly related to achievement. Moderation analyses indicated diminishing returns, as the associations between AI literacy and AI self-efficacy were stronger for lighter users and first-year students, and weaker with heavier use and in later years. Qualitative themes highlighted AI as a scaffold for summarizing, idea generation, and drafting; key frictions were accuracy, Vietnamese expression quality, and prompting skills. Recommendations for Practitioners Prioritize building AI self-efficacy with low-stakes practice, explicit error-spotting, claim-checking, and revision routines. Use a phased approach: offer light support for beginners, and in advanced years, require records of prompts and sources, comparative prompting, and clear citation and verification to reduce automation bias. Recommendations for Researchers Pursue longitudinal or experimental designs to test causal effects of self-efficacy and verification training and compare domain-specific contexts where task complexity and error costs differ. Impact on Society Practical guidance on the competent and critical use of AI can support the equitable, ethical, and effective integration of AI in higher education, helping students turn access to AI into real learning gains. Future Research Future studies can expand the scope of this research by extending it to diverse institutions, majors, and incorporating interviews to deepen insight into when, how, and why AI use builds or undermines self-efficacy, as well as how this connects to students' attitudes and perceived learning.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01833,Artificial intelligence adoption in higher education in Nigeria,"This study investigates lecturers’ views on the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in Nigerian higher education and analyzes the influence of gender and academic cadre on these perceptions. Despite a growing global focus on AI adoption in education, there is a limited body of research exploring gender-based and cadre based perceptions of AI among higher education lecturers in Nigeria. With the increasing use of General AI and Generative AI (GenAI) tools by students for academic tasks, questions have emerged around academic integrity, student dependence, and reduced critical thinking. The research was conducted at the Faculty of Education, Nnamdi Azikiwe University, Awka, Nigeria, using a quantitative survey approach. A structured 20-item questionnaire was distributed to 64 lecturers across various departments. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and Mann–Whitney U tests, with a significance level set at p ≤ 0.05. Findings show that lecturers expressed moderate concern about AI integration (Mean = 3.62), particularly with its potential to affect student learning behaviors. Views on the effectiveness of AI tools were also moderate (Mean = 3.05), with male lecturers and those in professorial roles rating AI more positively, though only gender-based attitudes toward AI use were statistically significant (p = 0.041). While female lecturers reported slightly higher concern, and male lecturers showed more favorable attitudes overall, the differences in concern and perceived effectiveness were not significant. Academic cadre did not produce any significant differences across the measured areas. Despite some variations, most lecturers expressed a shared readiness to discuss and engage with AI, as well as a clear need for training and support to ensure responsible and effective use in teaching. The findings suggest that while lecturers are not opposed to AI in education, their support depends on addressing ethical concerns and providing adequate institutional backing. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,1.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11191,EFL pre-service teachers’ acceptance of ChatGPT for writing: A sequential explanatory mixed-method study,"This study aims to examine EFL pre-service teachers’ acceptance of ChatGPT for their writing. In this context, acceptance refers to the pre-service teachers’ willingness and intention to use ChatGPT as a support tool for their academic writing tasks. A sequential explanatory mixed- method approach was employed, combining a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire with semi-structured interviews. Initially, 143 EFL pre-service teachers from four universities in Surakarta, Indonesia, completed the TAM questionnaire to assess their acceptance of ChatGPT. Subsequently, semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 participants to gain deeper insights into their perspectives on using ChatGPT for writing, a fundamental skill in EFL that demands high levels of linguistic accuracy, organization, and creativity, making it particularly sensitive to the influence of Artificial Intelligence tools like ChatGPT. The results revealed that the participants generally perceived ChatGPT as useful and easy to use, with a positive attitude toward the tool. Despite these favorable perceptions, the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT regularly was markedly lower, with participants expressing concerns about becoming overly reliant on AI. Qualitative data further confirmed that while participants acknowledged the potential of ChatGPT, many felt that further training and experience were necessary to integrate the tool effectively into their teaching practices. Ethical concerns (student over-reliance, which may lead to academic dishonesty) surrounding the over- dependence on AI for academic tasks were also noted. The findings highlight the need for targeted professional development and the careful consideration of ethical implications in integrating AI tools into language teaching, particularly for writing instruction. © © 2025, authors",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01138,Machine learning as an effective paradigm for persuasive message design,"The impact of the development of the internet and new communications channels on the marketing industry pushed practitioners to devise new tools and approaches for influencing consumer attitudes and behaviors towards products and services. This has led to new insights into persuasive message design. In general, persuasive advertisement messaging can be viewed as a combination of context, i.e., a message, and additional affiliated components such as images, video, and special graphics. It is composed out of two main attribute categorizations: (1) textual content such as a product description or affiliated message and (2) sensible content such as product image, color, or even scent. In a competitive market in which consumers are constantly exposed to a hyper-abundance of products that also contain sensible attributes, it is crucial to design persuasive messages that will maximally appeal to desired consumers and evoke their positive response. Yet only a few studies have focused on the effective design of persuasive advertisement messages characterized by two integrated elements. As such, this research focuses on effective persuasive message design with integrated product scent and color attributes. We demonstrate how a machine learning process can be utilized to generate optimal persuasive messages by estimating the contribution of each message attribute to the final class attribute: the purchase intention response. Our results show that several prediction algorithms can enhance consumer response value. In addition, correlations between several attributes affiliated with the message can be derived by graph theory-based estimation. This research thus provides insight into attribute values important for management decisions, with implications for effective persuasive message design. Ultimately, this may lead to higher response rates for marketing practitioners in an increasingly competitive market.

REC_09428,The Influence of Educational and Emotional Support on e-Learning Continuance Intention: A Two-Stage Approach PLS-SEM and ANN Analysis,"In the context of the digital era, e-learning has become an innovative and indispensable component of the educational sector. With the continuous advancement of technology and the widespread adoption of the internet, e-learning has demonstrated its key role in maintaining educational continuity and supporting remote teaching. However, despite the extensive applications and significant advantages of e-learning, the willingness of college students to continue using e-learning platforms is not always high, presenting a challenge for educators and technology developers. Based on the Expectation Confirmation Model, this study examines the influence of perceived educational and emotional support on the continuance intention of e-learning among college students. The researchers conducted a survey using a structured questionnaire randomly among 379 university students from three universities in Henan Province to measure their self-reported responses on six constructs: perceived educational support, perceived emotional support, perceived usefulness, confirmation, satisfaction, and continuance intention. The study uses the Structural Equation Modeling-Artificial Neural Network (SEM-ANN) method to elucidate the non-compensatory and non-linear relationships between predictive factors and e-learning continuance intention. Except for the direct effects of perceived educational support and perceived emotional support on perceived usefulness, which were not significant, all other hypotheses were confirmed. Moreover, according to the normalized importance obtained from the multilayer perceptron, satisfaction (100%) was found to be the most critical predictive factor, followed by confirmation (29.8%), perceived usefulness (28.2%), perceived educational support (22.7%), and perceived emotional support (21.8%). All constructs together accounted for 62.0% of the total variance in college students' e-learning continuance intention.

REC_03558,Fostering creativity-nurturing behaviors among nurse educators: Investigating the interplay between evidence-based practice climate and artificial intelligence competence self-efficacy,"Background: Fostering creativity in nursing education is essential for equipping students with critical thinking and problem-solving skills. Nurse educators play a pivotal role in nurturing creativity among nursing students, yet their effectiveness is shaped by institutional and technological influences. While an evidence-based practice (EBP) climate provides a structured framework for innovative teaching, the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in education necessitates that educators develop AI competence self-efficacy. AI tools, such as personalized learning systems, adaptive simulations, and data-driven decision-making platforms, enhance creativity-nurturing behaviors by supporting individualized student engagement and dynamic problem-solving approaches. However, the extent to which AI competence self-efficacy strengthens the relationship between EBP climate and creativity-nurturing behaviors remains underexplored. Objectives: To examine the relationship between EBP climate and creativity-nurturing behaviors among nurse educators, with a specific focus on the moderating role of AI competence self-efficacy. The key research question is: Does AI competence self-efficacy enhance the positive effect of EBP climate on creativity-nurturing behaviors among nurse educators? Design: A cross-sectional study. Methods: Data were collected from 570 nurse educators using a structured online questionnaire measuring EBP climate, AI competence self-efficacy, and creativity-nurturing behaviors. Regression analyses, including interaction terms, assessed the moderating role of AI competence self-efficacy. Results: Findings indicate that both EBP climate and AI competence self-efficacy significantly predict creativitynurturing behaviors. Furthermore, AI competence self-efficacy moderates this relationship, amplifying the positive effect for educators with higher AI competence. Conclusion: EBP climate and AI competence self-efficacy are crucial in fostering creativity-nurturing behaviors among nurse educators. Higher AI competence self-efficacy enhances the ability to leverage EBP climate for creative teaching. Implications: Nursing institutions should enhance AI competence among nurse educators through targeted AI literacy programs, faculty mentorship, and integration of AI-driven teaching tools to optimize creativitynurturing behaviors within an evidence-based educational environment.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12392,A Worldwide Study on Language Educators’ Initial Response to ChatGPT,"This exploratory study investigated how 367 university language educators from 48 countries/regions responded to ChatGPT in the first 10 weeks after its release. It explored awareness, use, attitudes, and perceived impact through a survey collecting both quantitative and qualitative data. Most participants demonstrated moderate awareness, but little teaching application. Around half had used ChatGPT in some way, but only a minority had used it for educational purposes. Interest was high but many concerns were raised, particularly about student misuse. Most teachers felt they were likely to use it for creating teaching resources but were less open to using it for automated feedback and assessment. Perceptions of the impact of ChatGPT were cautiously optimistic, with more positivity from users with first-hand experience. Concerns focused on misuse, while benefits were noted in terms of efficiency. Qualitative data were analysed using an adapted version of the Concerns-Based Adoption Model (CBAM), which revealed that teachers were primarily in the Management and Consequences stages of concern. Only very few had reached the latter stage of Collaboration and none were in the Refocusing stage, suggesting a gradual adoption process, which was expected given the timing of the study. Key implications are that educators need support in developing skills for pedagogical applications of ChatGPT, while critically evaluating appropriate use. More empirical evidence on effective practices is needed. This study provides baseline data on language teachers’ initial engagement with ChatGPT, highlighting promising directions but also remaining concerns.

REC_11223,BARRIERS AND COPING STRATEGIES IN MALL INTEGRATION: UNIVERSITY EFL INSTRUCTOR’S PERSPECTIVES,"This study examined the barriers and coping strategies involved in integrating Mobile-Assisted Language Learning (MALL), including AI-driven tools, among 399 EFL instructors. Through a survey and supplemental interviews, the research explored how instructors’ background characteristics influence their coping strategies and the barriers they encounter, as well as the relationship between these factors. Findings indicated a moderate level of overall perceived barriers, with extrinsic barriers rated higher than intrinsic barriers. Time constraints were identified as the most significant barrier. In terms of coping strategies, instructors predominantly relied on intrinsic factors over extrinsic ones, with attitude being the most utilized strategy. A strong negative correlation was found between perceived barriers and coping strategies, suggesting that instructors who perceive fewer barriers are more likely to employ coping strategies. No significant differences in perceived barriers or coping strategies were observed based on gender, age, position, teaching experience, area of specialization, or daily MALL usage. These findings accentuate the importance of addressing both extrinsic and intrinsic barriers to facilitate effective MALL integration. Implementing targeted interventions that provide technical support, institutional resources, and professional development, alongside strategies to foster positive attitudes and self-efficacy, is crucial in enabling EFL instructors to successfully integrate MALL into their teaching practices. © 2025, Anadolu Universitesi.

REC_01848,"Unveiling AI’s impact in Rwandan higher education: navigating trends, challenges, and imperatives at the University of Rwanda","In the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, which hastened the digitalization of education, the imperative to harness Artificial Intelligence (AI)'s potential has never been more pressing. While studies abound on the broader impact of technology in education, there remains a conspicuous gap in understanding its specific implications for African countries. These nations, historically marginalized in the discourse of technological advancement, confront unique challenges and opportunities in leveraging AI to advance their educational agendas. The objective of this contribution is to assess, and identify AI readiness with a focus on accompanying policy by an exemplary survey of academic practice at a East African higher education institution, the University of Rwanda. It encompasses three pivotal sections: an in-depth analysis of prevailing technological trends in academia, differentiating between AI and e-learning methodologies; an empirical investigation based on 32 responses of a structured online survey, featuring insights from teaching and research staff at the University of Rwanda; and an examination of policy implications informed by its findings, coupled with actionable recommendations to propel e-learning initiatives across Rwanda. The research questions address AI readiness on both the individual and the institutional level. Of exploratory nature, the theoretical framework is informed by the Technology Acceptance Model and constructive learning and interpretive theory. The results show that there is a perceived potential of AI that is particularly relevant for the African higher education context. It can enhance education through targeted and personalized learning, improve access to information, and facilitate research and teaching. There is, however, the need for regulatory frameworks and ethics considerations, more so that two response items are likely AI-generated. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03561,The implementation of artificial intelligence in nursing education and its psychological impact on nursing students: A cross-sectional study,"Background: The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into education has the potential to transform learning experiences, particularly in nursing. Understanding students' perceptions of AI and its impact on psychological factors, such as self-efficacy and psychological distress, is crucial for effective implementation. Objective: The purpose of this study was to identify the factors that influence nursing students' perceptions of AI, psychological distress, and self-efficacy. Design: A cross-sectional study design was used. Participants and setting: This study was conducted using a convenience sample of 108 nursing students from a public university in Saudi Arabia. Methods: Three instruments were used: The Perceptions of AI, Kessler Psychological Distress, and Self-Efficacy scales. Data were analyzed using independent sample t-tests, one-way ANOVA, Pearson's correlation, and multiple linear regression. Results: The study found that participants who used AI displayed significant differences in their self-efficacy. Additionally, notable associations were found between perceptions of AI, self-efficacy, and psychological distress. However, while the regression models were significant, the perceptions of AI did not meaningfully explain the variance in these outcomes (p > 0.05). Conclusions: This study highlights the significance of addressing students' perceptions of AI to improve their educational experiences and mental well-being. Future research should explore the longitudinal impact of mental health interventions in technology-driven learning environments.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01849,"Exploring graduate students’ use of generative artificial intelligence in Ghana: insights from an extended UTAUT2 model, PLS-SEM, IPMA and fsQCA","This study based on an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model, examines factors influencing graduate students' behavioural intention towards adoption and actual use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI). l. Using a cross-sectional data from 415 graduate students in Ghana, this study employed the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), importance-performance map analysis (IPMA), and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) for the analytical approach. The results from the PLS-SEM indicate that performance expectancy, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions, personal innovativeness, perceived learning opportunities and satisfaction significantly drive graduate students' behavioural intention towards the adoption of GenAI, whereas effort expectancy, social influence, habit, perceived enjoyment, and perceived risk showed no significant effects. Personal innovativeness, satisfaction, and behavioural intention were found to be the significant predictors of actual use behaviour of GenAI, while perceived risk did not. The IPMA highlighted satisfaction as the highest ranked importance factor and personal innovativene ranked as the highest performance factor, while perceived risk was ranked lowest for both importance and performance. The fsQCA further reveals nuanced results indicating that graduate students' low perceived risk combined with high perception of satisfaction, personal innovativeness, learning opportunities predict their intention and actual usage of GenAI. The combined PLS-SEM, IPMA, and fsQCA approach provides robust insights into GenAI adoption among students in higher education, highlighting the interplay of psychosocial perspectives and the need to enhance the functional benefits, user engagement, and institutional support for effective GenAI integration. Thus, this study has practical implications for improving GenAI infrastructure, enhancing user-centered design, fostering curiosity, and strengthening institutional support. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09437,Modeling ChatGPT Adoption Among Undergraduates: An Integrated UTAUT2 and Digital Competence Framework,"While Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies like ChatGPT are revolutionizing education by offering unique interaction opportunities and prompting legislative shifts toward AI literacy, there remains a significant gap in understanding the factors that influence their acceptance and effective use in educational settings. In particular, the impact of students' digital competencies and motivational factors on their acceptance and utilization of GenAI tools is not well understood. This study investigates how these variables influence undergraduate students' acceptance and use of ChatGPT as an informal learning tool, aiming to advance understanding of GenAI adoption in higher education. By integrating the Digital Competence Framework (DigComp) with the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2), this research provides a comprehensive analysis of factors affecting students' intention to use and actual use of ChatGPT. Data were collected from 544 undergraduate students using adapted UTAUT2 scales and digital competence measures aligned with DigComp. Confirmatory Factor Analysis (n = 140) validated the adapted UTAUT2, and Structural Equation Modeling (n = 404) explored relationships between variables. The findings reveal that habit, hedonic motivation, performance expectancy, and facilitating conditions significantly predict students' intention to use ChatGPT, while behavioral intention, problem-solving skills, and ethical considerations positively influence actual use. Notably, the study highlights the critical role of problem-solving and ethical awareness-in the adoption of GenAI tools. These results suggest that existing digital competence frameworks may need updating to include GenAI-specific competencies such as prompt-writing skills, managing ongoing dialogs with GenAI tools, and critically evaluating AI-generated content.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12397,Teachers’ Perceptions and Agency in Implementation of Artificial Intelligence: The Case of Uzbekistan,"The adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, such as generative AI (GenAI), follows a continuum, beginning with awareness and progressing to active engagement and leadership. The extent of its successful implementation, its impact on educators’ evolving roles, and the actual picture in the field need to be scrutinized. The effects of these dramatic changes are best known to those at the microlevel: teachers in the classroom. Therefore, to explore the status quo in the Uzbekistani context, the current study investigated the perceptions of teachers from 34 local and international higher education institutions representing five regions of the country. An online questionnaire was employed to survey English for academic purposes and English for specific purposes teachers’ (N = 141) general perceptions and experiences with AI. Meanwhile, adding breadth and depth to the research question, semi-structured interviews informed by a conceptual framework were used to probe teachers’ (n = 10) experiences, attitudes, and engagement with GenAI in their teaching activities and related professional work. The findings reveal that teachers are generally positive about implementing AI technologies in the educational process and have achieved a convincing degree of familiarity with a range of tools for various pedagogical purposes. The teachers’ responses also showed that they have achieved GenAI adopter and GenAI collaborator roles but have yet to gain enough knowledge and expertise to become GenAI innovators. © 2025 Iroda Saydazimova & Ozoda Saydazimova.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01850,Exploring the use of generative artificial intelligence tools among University Students in Ghana,"Background: Despite the growing adoption of AI tools, few empirical studies have comprehensively examined students’ familiarity, perceived benefits and challenges, and demographic factors such as gender, age, and academic level. This study aims to explore the familiarity, usage, perceived benefits and challenges, and how demographic factors influence AI tool adoption among university students in Ghana. Methods: A cross-sectional design was employed, sampling 353 students through snowball and convenience sampling techniques via online platforms such as WhatsApp groups. A structured questionnaire was developed for data collection, with independent sample t-tests and ANOVA utilised to compare AI tool usage between genders and across various age groups and academic levels, respectively. Results: The majority of students reported familiarity with tools such as MetaAI, ChatGPT, and Grammarly. Analysis indicated that male students used generative AI tools more frequently than their female counterparts. An independent samples t-test confirmed that this difference is statistically significant (t = 10.35, p < 0.001). Age also emerged as a significant factor (F = 110.46, p < 0.001), with younger students (under 25 years) engaging with generative AI tools more often than older age groups. A statistical difference was also observed related to students’ programme of study (F = 3.41, p < 0.002). No significant differences were noted across academic levels. Students perceived these tools as enhancing research efficiency, providing personalised learning support, and transforming education. However, they expressed concerns regarding the impact of these tools on critical thinking skills, the accuracy of generated information, and ethical implications. Conclusion: A balanced approach is needed to integrate generative AI tools in education, ensuring their benefits are maximised while addressing ethical concerns to preserve students’ critical thinking skills and uphold academic integrity. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01256,Validating student AI competency self‑efficacy (SAICS) scale and its framework,"Nurturing student artificial intelligence (AI) competency is crucial in the future of K-12 education. Students with strong AI competency should be able to ethically, safely, healthily, and productively integrate AI into their learning. Research on student AI competency is still in its infancy, primarily focusing on theoretical and professional discussions, along with qualitative investigations. This two-stage study aims to propose an AI competency framework for students and confirm the reliability and validity of its scale—student AI competency self-efficacy (SAICS)—in K-12 education. In stage 1, we used a three-round Delphi study to propose the framework and its scale. The framework has eight dimensions: interdisciplinary learning with AI, assessment with AI, decision-making with AI, data, ethics and AI, designing AI, multimedia creation with AI, human-centric learning, and confidence with AI. Each dimension contains four items. In stage 2, we involved 448 students to validate the scale using confirmatory factor analysis and model comparisons. The analyses showed that the scale is consistent across male and female students. The SAICS scale comprises 32 items and addresses eight dimensions of AI competency. Researchers can use the framework and SAICS to design their interventions and correlational research associated with student AI competency. Teachers can use them to develop learning outcomes for AI-based learning activities, and policymakers can use them to establish national AI standards.

AI readiness further enhances this innovation, fostering dynamic learning environments. However, research on how digital competence and AI readiness together have an impact on pedagogical innovation among nurse educators remains limited. Design: Cross-sectional study. Methods: Data were collected from 600 nurse educators across various nursing faculties in Egypt. Validated scales measured digital competence, AI readiness and pedagogical innovation. Pearson correlation, multiple regression and moderation analyses were used to test study hypotheses. Results: Significant positive correlations were found between pedagogical innovation, digital competence (r = 0.546, p < 0.01) and AI readiness (r = 0.530, p < 0.01). Digital competence (B = 0.558, p < 0.001) and AI readiness (B = 0.580, p < 0.001) significantly predicted pedagogical innovation. AI readiness moderated this relationship (B = 0.199, p < 0.001, Delta R-2 = 0.0057), amplifying the effect at higher levels of AI readiness (B = 0.66, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Digital competence and AI readiness play critical roles in promoting pedagogical innovation. Strengthening AI readiness through targeted training can enhance digital tools adoption in nursing education. It is crucial to revise academic standards for curricula and nurse educators to include AI competence, ensuring effective integration of AI and digital tools in nursing education through targeted training and infrastructure improvements.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03885,"Generative AI in student English learning in Thai higher education: More engagement, better outcomes?","Despite the growing body of research exploring artificial intelligence (AI) in educational contexts, there remains a critical gap in understanding the specific effects of generative AI (GAI) on English language learning, particularly within higher education in Thailand. This study addresses this gap by employing an explanatory sequential mixed-method design to explore both student and teacher perspectives. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Mann-Whitney U tests, Spearman correlation analysis, and Kendall–Theil regression to examine students' acceptance, usage, and the relationship between GAI engagement and academic performance. Qualitative data, collected through structured written interviews, were analyzed using thematic analysis to uncover key themes from both student and teacher narratives. Quantitative findings reveal high student acceptance of GAI tools in terms of performance expectancy (M = 3.66, SD = .58), effort expectancy (M = 3.61, SD = .59), facilitating conditions (M = 3.51, SD = .59), and use behavior (M = 3.52, SD = .48), while social influence remained relatively lower (M = 3.31, SD = .54). Mann-Whitney U tests showed no statistically significant differences in GAI usage across high- and low-performing students (p > .05). Correlation analyses indicated strong associations between performance expectancy and other factors (ρ = .87, p < .001), yet no significant correlation with GPA (ρ = −.06, p = .76). Qualitative results from student reflections revealed improved efficiency, enhanced engagement, and increased linguistic confidence. Yet, concerns about overreliance on AI and the necessity for critical use were noted. Teacher narratives accentuated ethical concerns and the potential for GAI misuse, highlighting the need for balanced, responsible integration of AI into pedagogical practices. These findings underscore the potential of GAI to enhance learning experiences while emphasizing the importance of maintaining academic integrity and fostering critical thinking. © 2024 The Authors",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09445,The Implementation of Artificial Intelligence in Moroccan Higher Education: Benefits and Challenges From the Perception of Academics,"This study explores academics' perspectives on integrating artificial intelligence (AI) into Moroccan higher education (HE). A questionnaire examining perceived benefits, challenges, and influence of demographic factors was distributed to 103 faculty members at the college of Arts and Humanities, Sidi Mohamed Ben Abdellah University in Fez, Morocco. The results reveal that AI offers promising opportunities to enhance educational practices by improving efficiency and providing valuable learning resources. However, participants also expressed concerns that increased use of AI may negatively impact student-instructor interactions and academic integrity. Preliminary analyses suggested age and academic discipline may shape views on AI, but robust statistical testing was needed. Overall, findings indicate AI adoption presents a dual-edged situation for HE. If properly planned and regulated and equity concerns are addressed, AI technologies can transform teaching and learning positively, but unaddressed challenges may undermine educational quality and student experiences.

REC_01854,Acceptance and use of artificial intelligence for self-directed research learning among postgraduate students in Nigerian public universities,"Research competence is a cornerstone of postgraduate education, yet many Nigerian students continue to struggle with essential processes such as literature review, methodological design, and data analysis. While artificial intelligence (AI) holds considerable promise in supporting self-directed research learning (SDRL), its adoption and practical use among postgraduate students in Nigeria remain underexplored. This study addresses that gap by investigating both the acceptance and use of AI tools for SDRL among postgraduate students in Nigerian public universities. Adopting a predictive correlational design, data were collected from 456 students across two institutions using stratified random sampling. Two validated instruments (10-item scales; α = 0.85 and α = 0.87) were administered both physically and digitally to assess students’ acceptance of AI and their actual use of AI for SDRL. Descriptive statistics and linear regression were used to analyse patterns and predict usage based on acceptance. Findings revealed a high level of AI acceptance (M = 3.30/4.00), yet a considerably lower level of actual AI usage (M = 2.26/4.00) for self-directed research learning. A weak but statistically significant relationship was observed between acceptance and use of AI for self-directed research learning (R2 = 0.01, β = 0.11, p < 0.05), suggesting that acceptance alone does not translate into meaningful engagement. These results highlight a pressing need to move beyond enthusiasm and address practical barriers to AI usage for self-directed research learning, such as limited training opportunities, inadequate mentorship, and infrastructural constraints. Targeted institutional interventions aimed at building AI literacy and integrating AI tools into research support systems could bridge this gap, thereby strengthening postgraduate research capacity and improving learning outcomes in Nigerian higher education. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07624,Creating a Novel Approach to Examine How King Saud University's Arts College Students Utilize AI Programs,"One of the cutting-edge ideas that is essential to improving students' behavioral intention for using artificial intelligence (AI) and attitude toward it (ATAI) at higher education institutions is artificial intelligence learning. Artificial intelligence education is not widely available in Saudi Arabian universities. The study's goal is to ascertain how perceptions of assessment quality, perceived risk, price value, artificial intelligence anxiety, educational quality, and perceived AI intelligence affect attitudes toward and perceived usefulness of employing artificial intelligence. When attempting to encourage the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education, take into account factors such as perceived utility, attitude toward AI, behavioral intention to use, user happiness, and general mindset regarding AI. Additionally considered is the mediating function that behavioral intention and user pleasure have when utilizing artificial intelligence (USAI). A survey of Saudi universities was conducted in order to meet the study's goal. 183 questionnaires were distributed around the universities to collect student data. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis and structural equation modeling were utilized to examine the data once it was gathered. User satisfaction in using artificial intelligence is the most crucial element in promoting student adoption of AI in higher education (beta = 0.646, t-value = 10.402). Perceived usefulness of using artificial intelligence ( beta = 0.309, t-value = 4.240; 3 = 0.275, t-value = 2.194; and beta = 0.473, t-value = 7.619, respectively) and attitude toward artificial intelligence (beta = 0.285, t-value = 2.584; and beta= 0.151, t-value = 2.453, respectively) are significant factors in transferring the positive effects of behavioral intention to use and user satisfaction in using artificial intelligence. A crucial part of communicating the positive impacts of AI adoption in higher education is also played by user satisfaction (beta = 0.646, t-value = 10.402, respectively) and behavioral intention to use AI (beta = 0.174, t-value = 2.817, respectively). We can better comprehend Saudi undergraduates' motivation to use artificial intelligence (AI) for learning in higher education thanks to this study, which combines the TAM model and UTAUT theory. Future research in educational environments can make use of this theoretical framework. Furthermore, this study provides educators and educational institutions with some recommendations on how to motivate students to use AIto achieve better outcomes.",2025,WoS; Scopus; IEEE,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

It also examined the mediating role of AI use frequency in the relationship between personality and satisfaction. Background With AI increasingly integrated into nursing education, understanding how individual learner traits shape engagement with these tools is essential for optimizing learning experiences. Design A cross-sectional, correlational design was used. Methods A total of 159 undergraduate nursing students from King Faisal University completed an online survey, including the NEO Five-Factor Inventory and the AI in Nursing Education Questionnaire (AINEQ). Descriptive statistics, logistic regression and path analysis were performed to assess associations and mediation. Results Openness and Conscientiousness significantly predicted frequent AI use (p < 0.01), while Neuroticism negatively predicted satisfaction (p = 0.03). AI use frequency significantly mediated the relationship between personality traits (Openness, Conscientiousness) and satisfaction (indirect beta s = 0.13 and 0.11, p < 0.01). Extraversion and Agreeableness were not significantly related to AI use. Female students and those in advanced academic levels reported greater AI engagement. Conclusion Personality traits influence AI adoption and satisfaction among nursing students.

A total of 499 university students' data were utilized to examine the relationship model. Results revealed a significant negative correlation between self-esteem and GAI dependency (r = - 0.19). Mediation analyses demonstrated that academic anxiety partially explains this relationship, while perceived usefulness functioned as a suppressor, paradoxically amplifying dependency despite self-esteem's protective effects. These findings suggest a dual-pathway mechanism: self-esteem reduces GAI dependency by alleviating academic anxiety yet inadvertently increases dependency through enhanced perceptions of GAI's utility. The study provides concrete theoretical contributions by integrating affective and cognitive pathways into a unified framework of technology dependency, while offering practical guidance for developing differentiated interventions, psychological support targeting academic anxiety for vulnerable students versus critical digital literacy education for cognitively engaged users.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Results showed that 5 out of 9 hypothesized paths are significant. Results revealed that social influence and perceived knowledge of using AI are significant predictors of attitude toward using AI, and only three have a significant effect on behavioral intention: performance expectancy, perceived knowledge of using AI, and attitude towards using AI. These findings suggest that the people around them and their knowledge of AI tools affect learners' attitudes toward using AI. Learners intend to use AI because they believe that AI will help improve their work, they have the knowledge of using AI, and they have a positive attitude towards using AI. © 2024 The Author(s)",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03585,Artificial intelligence in Nigerian nursing education: Are future nurses prepared for the digital revolution in healthcare?,"Aim/Objective: This study aims to assess the knowledge, exposure, and willingness of Nigerian nursing students to integrate artificial intelligence (AI) into healthcare, identifying gaps that may hinder its adoption. Background: AI is revolutionizing healthcare through improved diagnostics, predictive analytics, and automated administrative processes. However, research on AI awareness and adoption among nursing students in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), particularly in Nigeria, remains limited. Understanding the preparedness of future nurses for AI integration is crucial for optimizing healthcare delivery and education. Design: A cross-sectional study design was employed to evaluate AI knowledge, exposure, and adoption readiness among nursing students in Nigeria. Methods: The study involved 676 nursing students from five universities in Nigeria. A structured questionnaire was administered to assess sociodemographic characteristics, AI knowledge, exposure to AI facilities, and willingness to adopt AI technologies. Data were analyzed using descriptive and inferential statistics with Microsoft Excel and JASP 0.19. Associations were tested using ANOVA and Chi-square tests at a 95 % confidence interval (p < 0.05). Results: Findings revealed that 98 % of students had low AI knowledge, with only 1.8 % demonstrating average knowledge and 0.15 % showing high knowledge. Despite this, 85.5 % were willing to take AI training, and 92.6 % believed AI could enhance healthcare workflow. However, concerns regarding inadequate infrastructure (43.5 %) and privacy issues (37.1 %) were prevalent. Significant associations were found between AI knowledge and location, self-perception, and willingness to train (p < 0.001). Conclusions: The study highlights critical knowledge gaps in AI among Nigerian nursing students despite a high willingness for adoption. AI education should be integrated into nursing curricula, and infrastructure improvements are necessary to support AI implementation in healthcare. Addressing these gaps will better prepare nursing students for the evolving landscape of AI-driven healthcare.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03889,"AI in academia: How do social influence, self-efficacy, and integrity influence researchers' use of AI models?","The integration of artificial intelligence models into academic settings has experienced remarkable growth in recent years. Given that researchers' interactions with and perceptions of these technologies can substantially influence academic procedures and outputs, identifying the key determinants of their incorporation into university environments is crucial. This investigation pursued two main objectives: first, to identify the variables that condition the implementation of AI models in research activities, and second, to analyze how perceived ethical considerations and academic integrity influence their adoption. The empirical study was conducted through a digital survey administered to 302 academic researchers from Peruvian public and private universities. The analytical methodology employed structural equation modeling and confirmatory factor analysis, grounded in an expanded version of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 model. The results demonstrated that six out of nine hypotheses were supported; social influence, educational self-efficacy, and academic integrity were identified as primary factors predicting researchers' use of AI models. Effort expectancy had a significant negative effect on AI model use. Furthermore, the use of AI models was found to significantly influence both teachers' concerns and perceived ethics among academics. Notably, performance expectancy, technological self-efficacy, and personal anxiety did not significantly affect AI model use. This study contributes to the understanding of AI adoption in academic research by highlighting the importance of social, educational, and ethical factors. These findings have implications for developing policies and training programs to promote responsible AI use in higher education and suggest a need to reevaluate traditional technology acceptance models in the context of AI in academia. © 2025 The Authors",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,E3,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09450,"Exploring Saudi EFL Learners' Engagement with ChatGPT: A Mixed-Methods Study of Perceptions, Attitudes, and Intentions","This study explores Saudi EFL learners' perceptions, attitudes, and intentions regarding using ChatGPT as an AI-mediated tool for English language learning. Employing a mixed-methods design, 181 students completed a survey, and 4 participated in follow-up interviews to offer a more nuanced understanding of learner experiences. Quantitative findings reveal high perceived usefulness (M = 3.9), a generally pleasant user experience (M = 3.95), and a firm intention to continue using the tool (M = 3.7). Pearson correlation analysis confirmed significant positive relationships between perception and intention (r = .797, p < .001) and between attitude and intention (r = .733, p < .001), thereby reinforcing the explanatory power of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) in the Saudi EFL context. Qualitative findings add depth to the statistical trends, showcasing that Saudi EFL considered ChatGPT not merely a functional platform but an emotionally supportive and context-sensitive mediator in their academic language development. Students demonstrated critical agency, using the tool strategically for scaffolding, meaning-making, and managing learning anxiety while remaining vigilant about its limitations. Participants expressed concerns about over-reliance on AI, warning against diminished critical thinking, intellectual complacency, and the erosion of human interaction in education. Framed through the dual lenses of TAM and sociocultural theory, the study argues that learners do not passively adopt ChatGPT; instead, they negotiate its role as a complementary and temporary scaffold that enhances but does not replace human faculties and social learning environments. Thus, the study underscores the need for pedagogically grounded and ethically informed integration of AI into language education. These findings offer valuable implications for designing more balanced, culturally responsive, and learner-centered approaches to technology use in Saudi EFL classrooms.

REC_07629,AI Adoption for Collaboration: Factors Influencing Inclusive Learning Adoption in Higher Education,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies into education has gained considerable attention for its potential to revolutionize teaching and learning practices. Despite this, the adoption of AI in higher education, particularly to support inclusive learning environments, remains insufficiently studied. This research examines the factors affecting the adoption of AI for collaboration among university students, with a focus on promoting inclusivity. Data was gathered from 443 students at King Faisal University using a survey designed to measure constructs related to AI adoption in collaborative learning. The questionnaire, based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), was tailored to the educational AI context. Structural equation modeling (SEM) and hypothesis testing were applied to evaluate the relationships between constructs. The results indicated that perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and behavioral intention to use AI are significant predictors of AI adoption among students. Additionally, trust and familiarity with AI were identified as key drivers of behavioral intention. However, the hypothesis that the perceived quality of AI output influences perceived usefulness was not supported, suggesting students may not strongly link the quality of AI outputs to its usefulness in academic contexts. This study adds to the body of literature by providing empirical insights into the factors influencing AI adoption for collaboration, offering practical recommendations for creating more inclusive and effective educational environments. The study highlights the importance of building student trust and familiarity with AI to enhance its adoption for inclusive and collaborative learning in higher education.",2025,WoS; Scopus; IEEE,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

However, empirical studies on integrating ChatGPT or other LLMs into language learning platforms remain limited. In response to this gap, the present study examines the acceptance of an LLM-assisted reading platform. In this platform, LLM is used to generate glossary, translations, assessment questions, and to provide instant assistance through an embedded Chatbot. A post-usage survey based on the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, with the additional constructs of perceived intelligence and task-technology fit, was administered to 175 undergraduates in China, following 1 month of platform use. PLS-SEM analysis indicated that usability-related constructs, specifically effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions, didn't significantly influence undergraduates' behavioral intention to use the platform. In contrast, given LLMs' flexible alignment with diverse reading tasks, perceived intelligence and task-technology fit emerged as crucial drivers of sustained engagement, alongside other significant performance-oriented and affective factors, such as performance expectancy and hedonic motivation. Furthermore, it was observed that social influence also had a considerable effect on undergraduates' behavioral intention of using that platform. These findings offer important implications for the design and application of LLM-assisted educational technologies, highlighting the importance of learners' performance objectives, playful features, and social drivers.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Drawing on Sensemaking Theory, the Digital Mindset Framework, and Algorithm Aversion Theory, the study employs a three-wave survey of 366 instructors in Guangdong Province and analyzes the data using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM). Findings reveal that digital mindset and AI sensemaking significantly predict AI integration, while trust in AI and digital teaching competence do not have direct or consistent mediating effects. Surprisingly, perceived institutional support negatively moderates the relationship between digital mindset and both AI sensemaking and trust, suggesting that overly directive support may undermine autonomy in open education settings. The study contributes theoretically by extending digital mindset and sensemaking frameworks to the AI-in-education context and offering a context-sensitive interpretation of trust theory. Practically, it highlights the need for autonomy-respecting, interpretive support structures and mindset-based training programs.

REC_01860,Adoption and use of artificial intelligence tools in education: a UTAUT2-based study of school and university students in Surat city,"Artificial intelligence is rapidly advancing becoming increasingly pervasive. AI is expected to impact various professional and personal domains. Amidst the various available applications of AI, there are many which can be used in education for writing, correcting grammar, paraphrasing, rewriting, referencing, citation, creating text including creative writing tasks and adaptive writing style modifications. There are tools which help students solve math problems and even write full length essays or answers to questions. All these tools could facilitate education, educators and learners profoundly, provided they are used ethically and wisely. The paper seeks to examine the factors affecting the adaptability of open source or free versions of Artificial Intelligence tools by school and university students between grade 9 to university (age between 14 and 22 years) for their academic work. The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) model has been deployed for the same. The sample consisted of 165 students from schools as well as university in Surat city using non-probability judgemental technique of sampling. Descriptive research design was deployed. The measurement scale consisted of 27 items of the UTAUT2 scale. Literature review and structural equation modelling using Smart PLS were the methods used for analysis. Path analysis shows that Habit, Facilitating Conditions, and Social Influence strongly influence Behavioural Intention and Use Behaviour. Indirect effect analysis confirms Behavioural Intention mediates these relationships. The study finds Behavioural Intention (R² = 0.801) and Use Behaviour (R² = 0.705) as key mediators of technology adoption among students. Habit, Facilitating Conditions, and Social Influence exert the strongest direct influence. The model fit indices confirm robustness, emphasizing ease of use, enjoyment, and habitual engagement underscoring the need for tailored strategies in education. Policymakers, educators, and tech providers can enhance students’ technology adoption by ensuring ease of use, adequate support, habit formation, and engaging content. Promoting social influence, demonstrating learning benefits, and implementing age-appropriate policies will drive effective and sustained digital learning. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02479,The association between groups' interactions with the Visual-GenAI learning analytics feedback and student engagement in CSCL,"Promoting student engagement has long been a vital subject in the research of Computer-Supported Collaborative Learning (CSCL). Previous research has indicated the potential of AI-based visual learning analytics feedback and generative AI (GenAI) feedback in this context. However, there is currently a lack of definitive research on the combined impact of these two types of intelligent feedback in CSCL. Additionally, limited attention has been paid to how groups utilize these tools in CSCL practice and the differences that may exist. In this study, we developed an Visual-GenAI learning analytics feedback tool that integrates AI-based visual learning analytics feedback and GenAI-based feedback. We then evaluated the differences in groups' interactions with this Visual-GenAI learning analytics feedback and its association with student engagement and academic performance. The study employed a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative analysis of feedback interaction log data, content analysis of group discussion data, and qualitative analysis of students' perceptions of different feedback tools through surveys. Our results show that groups exhibit four distinct levels of feedback interaction behavior patterns with the Visual-GenAI learning analytics feedback. These four patterns exhibit significant differences in behavioral engagement, emotional engagement, cognitive engagement, and academic performance. This study's significance lies in its potential contribution to future research on examining group behavior and optimizing learning using AI-based visual learning analytics feedback and GenAI-based feedback.

REC_02481,Embracing the challenge: Predicting self-testing in non-formal online courses using machine learning,"Technology-driven advancements have made adaptive and interactive learning techniques more accessible. Online courses increasingly integrate self-tests that offer automated and immediate feedback. Self-tests can help learners to identify knowledge gaps and to reinforce their retention and comprehension. However, not all learners readily use self-tests, raising the question of which factors may impact learners' engagement with self-tests. The present study focused on non-formal education, covering 45 online courses offered by Bavarian universities. Analyses were based on a sample of N = 1261 participants aged 16-84 years. We used a machine learning approach to predict learners' engagement with self-tests and to identify important influencing factors. Therefore, we included 50 predictor variables in an elastic net regression to explore the role of learner- and course-related characteristics. The predictor variables were drawn from self-report, process, and meta data. Overall, learners differed substantially in their self-testing behavior. The prediction model explained 11 % of the variance in learners' engagement with self-tests. Despite the model's modest explanatory power, the analysis identified potentially relevant predictors. The two most important predictor variables were learner commitment and the intention to obtain a confirmation of participation. Accordingly, course designers might implement extrinsic incentives-such as confirmations of participation-as a potentially useful strategy to encourage learners' engagement with self-tests. From a methodological perspective, the study highlights the importance of using appropriate statistical methods-such as machine learning algorithms-to understand complex learning behaviors.",2026,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.32,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09475,The Impact of Artificial Intelligence Attitudes and Acceptance on Critical Thinking Motivation among Nursing Students in Saudi Arabia,"Introduction: As Saudi Arabia advances its Vision 2030 agenda, which emphasizes artificial intelligence (AI) integration in healthcare and education, understanding students' acceptance of AI in academic settings is increasingly important. Objective: To examine the relationship between nursing students' attitudes toward AI, perceived usefulness, perceived usability, and their critical thinking motivation. Methods: A multicenter cross-sectional correlational study was conducted across three Saudi universities. Data were collected from 390 undergraduate nursing students using the General Attitudes towards AI Scale, the technology acceptance model questionnaire, and the critical thinking motivation scale. Analysis included Pearson correlations and multiple linear regression. Results: Students reported positive attitudes toward AI, with strong correlations among AI attitude, usefulness, and usability (r = .63-.78, p < .001). Weak but significant positive correlations were found between AI-related factors and critical thinking motivation (r = .20-.40, p < .001). Higher academic level, the belief that AI will not replace nursing roles, and greater AI usability significantly predicted critical thinking motivation (adjusted R-2 = .245, p < .001). Conclusion Acceptance and perceived usability of AI tools are positively associated with critical thinking motivation in nursing students. These findings underscore the potential of AI to support cognitive skill development in nursing education. Educators should integrate AI early in nursing curricula, provide structured training, and frame AI as a support tool in clinical decision-making.

REC_01453,Whether perceived TPACK could improve deep learning? Through the lens of the mediating role of self-regulatory learning and the moderating role of technology self-efficacy in the online environment,"Digitization of the higher education system and artificial intelligence embedding are essential to promote students' deep learning. Teachers also widely use digital technology in the online environment. However, whether students can achieve deep learning is still a problem online. Therefore, this study aims to investigate whether perceived TPACK could influence deep learning, and through the lens of the mediating effect of self-regulatory learning and the moderating effect of technology self-efficacy, investing influences factors in exploring how to influence deep learning and achieve deeper learning. This study used a Wenjuanxing e-questionnaire platform collecting 400 students online learning questionnaires, three universities, and freshmen (n = 170, 42.5%), sophomores (n = 52, 13.0%), juniors (n = 160, 40.0%), and seniors (n = 18, 4.5%), and then, applying SPSS 26.0 and AMOS 24.0 to test the reliability and validity of the instruments with exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and to test moderating and mediating effect with correlation analysis, structural equation model (SEM) and regression analysis. Perceived TPACK has a significant effect on deep learning; self-regulatory learning has a mediating effect between perceived TPACK and deep learning; technology self-efficacy has a negatively moderating effect between perceived TPACK and self-regulatory learning. However, technology self-efficacy has no moderating effect between perceived TPACK and deep learning. Technology self-efficacy significantly impacts self-regulatory and deep learning and can be used as a substitute for perception teachers' TPACK. This study's results make contributions to the growing literature and theory about these four variables, as well as beneficial to the practical online teaching and learning environment, which provides some influence perspective on how to improve online teaching and learning.",2024,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01905,Validating the AI-assisted second language (L2) learning attitude scale for Chinese college students and its correlation with L2 proficiency,"The positive impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) on second language (L2) learning is well -documented. An individual's attitude toward AI significantly influences its adoption. Despite this, no specific scale has been designed to measure this attitude, particularly in the Chinese context. To address this gap, our study aims to construct the AI -Assisted L2 Learning Attitude Scale for Chinese College Students (AL2AS-CCS) and evaluate its reliability, validity, and relationship with L2 proficiency. Our research comprises two phases, each involving separate samples. In Phase One (Sample 1: n = 379), we conducted exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to determine the factor structure of the AL2AS-CCS. The resulting two -factor structure consists of 12 items, categorized into cognitive and behavioral components. In Phase Two (Sample 2: n = 429), we performed confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) to validate the factor structure and assess model fit. CFA in Sample 2 confirmed the factor structure and demonstrated a good model fit. Additionally, the AL2AS-CCS exhibited high criterion validity, internal consistency, and cross -gender invariance. Our findings suggest that the AL2AS-CCS is a valid measurement tool for assessing Chinese college students' attitude toward AI -assisted L2 learning. Moreover, Chinese college students were discovered to maintain a moderately positive attitude toward AI -assisted L2 learning. Additionally, a positive correlation was identified between this attitude and their L2 proficiency.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02506,Exploring AI integration in continuing pharmacy education: A survey of emerging institutional practice and initial guidance,"Introduction: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping pharmacy continuing education (CE), offering innovative content generation and administrative efficiencies. However, concerns regarding content validity, ethical implications, and responsible use remain underexplored among CE providers. This study aimed to evaluate the perspectives, practices, and needs of Continuing Pharmacy Education (CPE) providers regarding AI integration. Methods: In 2023 and 2025, the Accreditation Council for Pharmacy Education (ACPE) administered a cross-sectional survey to all accredited CPE providers (n = 260 in 2023 and n = 262 in 2025). Questions assessed presence of AI policies, current applications, faculty/staff training, anticipated future uses, and organizational concerns. Quantitative data were analyzed using descriptive statistics; open-ended responses were analyzed using a general inductive approach. Results: Response rates were 15 % (n = 39) in 2023 and 17.6 % (n = 46) in 2025. In 2023, only one provider (2.6 %) reported an AI policy; by 2025, 17 providers (37 %) had implemented one. Common AI applications included refining tone and wording, generating presentation titles/objectives, drafting assessment items, performing gap analyses, and suggesting conference themes. Few organizations offered formal AI training, a minority embedded guidance or disclosure protocols within speaker toolkits. Primary concerns centered on legality, liability, best practices, and content validity. Conclusions: Although adoption of AI policy is increasing among CPE providers, gaps persist in training, ethical guidance, and implementation support. ACPE has created guidance for CE/CPD organizations seeking to assess AI readiness, standardize usage guidelines, and integrate transparent AI strategies into instructional design, supporting ethical, effective AI integration in CE.",2026,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.1,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01457,Antecedents of artificial intelligence and learners demographic characteristics in higher education: implication for human resource managers,"This study examined the effect of demographic characteristics on the antecedents of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education. These antecedents, also known as dimensions of AI in this study, were AI platform patronization, AI usage, AI benefits and AI challenges experienced by graduate students in higher education. The study was guided by the positivist philosophical position and the quantitative approach as well as the explanatory study design. The study sampled 294 graduates out of a population of 1189 graduates from a public university. Stratified sampling was employed to determine the level and types of academic programs pursued and the participants' gender. A structured questionnaire was used to gather data for the study. The data gathered were analyzed with descriptive statistics such as frequencies and percentages for demographic characteristics, and inferential statistics such as t-test statistics and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used to address the hypotheses guiding the study. Statistical tools (t-test statistics and ANOVA) were used to examine how demographic characteristics such as gender, academic programs and academic level influenced the adoption of AI platforms, AI usage, AI benefits and AI challenges among graduate students. The study revealed that there was a significant difference between the sex of graduate students and the antecedents of AI, such as ChatGPT, Quillbot, AI usage, and AI benefits, among graduate students. There were also significant differences between programs pursued in graduate studies and AI antecedents such as ChatGPT, Quillbot, AI usage, AI benefits, and AI challenges. Finally, the study revealed that the level of academic programs influenced the appreciation of AI tools such as ChatGPT and Quillbot and the challenges associated with AI in higher education. The results indicate that AI usage and its associated benefits differ among graduate students in terms of gender. The study concluded that its findings have practical, theoretical, and policy implications for university administrators in higher education. It was therefore recommended that the Deans and Registrars of Graduate Schools in Developing Economies provide clear gendered policy and support systems for AI usage in higher education. Thus, AI policies should address disparities between male and female graduate students in terms of usage, challenges and benefits.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01906,"What drives college students to use AI for L2 learning? Modeling the roles of self-efficacy, anxiety, and attitude based on an extended technology acceptance model","Prior research highlights the critical role of AI in enhancing second language (L2) learning. However, the factors that practically affect L2 learners to engage with AI resources are still underexplored. Given the widespread availability of digital devices among college students, they are particularly poised to benefit from AI-assisted L2 learning. As such, this study, grounded in an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), investigates the predictors of college L2 learners' actual use of AI tools, focusing on AI self-efficacy, AI-related anxiety, and their overall attitude toward AI. Data was gathered from 429 L2 learners at Chinese universities via an online questionnaire, utilizing four established scales. Through structural equation modeling (SEM) via AMOS 24, the results indicate that AI self-efficacy could negatively affect AI anxiety, and positively influence both learners' attitude toward AI and their actual use of AI tools. Besides, AI anxiety negatively predicted the actual use of AI. Moreover, AI self-efficacy was a positive predictor of AI use through reducing AI anxiety, enhancing attitude toward AI, or a combination of both.

REC_11312,Would Lecturers Use AI-Based Software to Write Scientific Article? A Quantitative Approach in Indonesia,"AI-based (artificial intelligence) software utilization is increasingly widespread, including in education. On the one hand, AI-based software offers advantages for producing quality writing, such as converting voice into text, summarizing paragraphs, and improving grammar. There are pros and cons to each argument. Interestingly, permission or prohibition on using software is only for students, not lecturers. Moreover, lecturers should write quality scientific articles productively so that AI-based software can facilitate writing. Therefore, this research explores the driving and inhibiting factors that are thought to influence the use of AI-based software to assist lecturers in writing scientific articles. Following its goals, this research identified the potential factors through six hypotheses and tested them using PLS-SEM. This research recruited 110 lecturers in Indonesia as respondents to express their quantitative perceptions. It found that Product Quality (QLT) and Security (SEC) factors influence lecturers' use of AI-based software in scientific writing. However, four other variables (Motivation/MOT, Supporting Ability/SUP, Subjective Norms/NOR, and Individual Ability/ABL) had no influence. The finding exposed software quality has a vital role in engaging lecturers' intention to use AI-based software considering its characteristics to satisfy their needs: usefulness, easiness, accuracy, and efficiency. Also, lecturers are concerned with information security since AI-based software captures personal data, including user behavior during its usage. This research promotes practical implications for universities to regulate AI-based software, considering its benefits have been recognized by lecturers. However, its misuse can lead to the university's credibility in research and should be mitigated. ©: ©2024 The authors.",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01466,Research on influencing factors and mechanisms of college students' use of artificial intelligence tools based on sor and rational behavior models,"This study aims to investigate the influencing factors and mechanisms of college students' AI tool usage behavior by integrating the Stimulus-Organism-Response (SOR) model with the rational behavior model. Using structural equation modeling, we analyzed data from 1,287 college students measuring self-media advertising influence, peer influence, self-efficacy, cognitive attitudes, educational regulations, and usage behavior. Results show that self-media advertising (beta = 0.091, p < 0.01), peer influence (beta = 0.151, p < 0.001), and self-efficacy (beta = 0.669, p < 0.001) significantly influence students' attitudes toward AI tools, with self-efficacy demonstrating the most substantial effect (f(2)= 1.492). Mediation analysis reveals that cognitive attitudes and educational regulations are significant mediating pathways, with the integrated model showing strong explanatory power (R-2= 0.89). This study concludes that while external stimuli affect students' adoption of AI tools through dual mediating pathways of attitudes and regulations, internal psychological factors play a more decisive role. The findings suggest that educational institutions should develop comprehensive AI literacy programs while establishing well-designed regulatory frameworks to guide appropriate AI tool usage.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03939,Global and educational disparities in AI integration: A study of L2 teacher training and usage patterns,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping education by introducing tools that enhance teaching methodologies, personalize learning, and streamline administrative tasks. However, adoption of these tools remains uneven, raising concerns about disparities in AI literacy and competency across geographic regions and educational contexts. Through the lens of Innovation Diffusion Theory, we investigated the adoption of GenAI tools among second language (L2) teachers in the United States, Colombia, Germany, and Macau. Using survey data, we assessed four areas: accessibility of GenAI tools, teacher knowledge of potential applications, integration in teaching practices, and the nature of professional development provided. Our results indicated substantial intra- and inter-context variance, with U.S. and Colombian educators reporting higher familiarity and usage compared to those from Germany and Macau. Additionally, university and high school teachers were more likely to access professional development and leverage GenAI for tasks like assessment and differentiation than elementary or middle school educators, regardless of geographic setting. These disparities align with broader trends in AI adoption, reflecting heterogeneity in cultural attitudes, systemic barriers, and institutional support. These findings contribute to Innovation Diffusion Theory by illustrating how accessibility, knowledge, and institutional support interact across diverse contexts. They offer practical guidance for policymakers and educational leaders to develop targeted interventions that promote equitable GenAI integration in language education worldwide.",2026,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.33,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The first main purpose of the present studywas to develop and test scales that assess students' (1) knowledge about ChatGPT, (2) actual ChatGPT usage and perceived value of use, and (3) attitude towards ChatGPT. Our second aim was to examine the intercorrelations between these scales, and to investigate differences (a) across five academic fields (i.e., human sciences, social sciences, teaching profession, health sciences, and law and economics) and (b) between stages of education (i.e., number of semesters). N = 693 students from various German universities participated in our online survey. Quality checks (Cronbach's alpha, MacDonald's omega, and confirmatory factor analyses) show satisfactory results for all scales. The scales all positively relate to each other, except for the knowledge and attitude scales. This means that more knowledge about ChatGPT is connected to a less favorable attitude regarding the generative AI tool.

REC_01917,Examining the role of Chinese language learners' grit and self-efficacy on their engagement in artificial intelligence-driven settings,"Background: The presentation of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the educational domain has turned conventional learning settings into advanced tools that maximize the performance of students. Engagement is a crucial determinant of students' success in AI-driven settings. However, identifying how psychological variables like selfefficacy and grit influence engagement in such settings is an emerging area in education. Directed by Selfdetermination theory (SDT), the present research aims to examine the interaction between students' grit, selfefficacy, and engagement. Methods: The data were collected from 382 students in three Chinese universities with a range of academic majors. The three questionnaires were administered, and following data collection, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to determine the model, and multiple regression analyses tested the predictive power of selfefficacy and grit on learners' engagement. Results: Grit positively predicts engagement, suggesting that learners with higher levels of perseverance and consistency are more likely to believe in their capabilities and actively participate in learning activities. In turn, self-efficacy has a direct effect on engagement, implying that confidence in one's abilities contributes meaningfully to students' engagement in academic tasks. Conclusion: The finding suggests that these two psychological constructs play a substantial and statistically significant role in shaping how actively and meaningfully students participate in AI-driven settings. Practical recommendations are aimed at enhancing learners' self-efficacy and grit, thus boosting engagement. These results contribute to a broader picture of SDT's application in AI-driven settings, offering ground for further research into motivational processes in such learning.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03989,Understanding AI tool engagement: A study of ChatGPT usage and word-of-mouth among university students and office workers,"This study aims to explore the determinants of user behaviors toward an artificial intelligence (AI) tool, ChatGPT, focusing on university students and office workers. In this study, we present a comprehensive model to understand user engagement with AI tools, specifically focusing on ChatGPT. The model is grounded on four primary stages, each containing distinct variables: 1) fundamental (comprising perceived intelligence and system quality), 2) knowledge and service (covering knowledge acquisition, application, personalization, and trust), 3) gain with user tendency (encompassing utilitarian benefits, individual impact, satisfaction, and personal innovativeness), and 4) behavior (including behavioral intention, continued usage, and Word-of-Mouth (WOM)). A total of 13 variables have been examined. A survey was conducted on a sample of 645 university students and office workers, and the collected data were analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM). The results reveal significant associations between perceived intelligence and knowledge management, and personalization. System quality also significantly impacts knowledge management and personalization. Knowledge acquisition and application were found to significantly affect utilitarian benefits and individual impact, but not satisfaction. Personalization significantly influenced utilitarian benefits, individual impact, and satisfaction. Trust significantly impacts behavioral intention. Utilitarian benefits and individual impact had a positive effect on satisfaction, behavioral intention, and WOM. Personal innovativeness was significantly associated with behavioral intention. Behavioral intention significantly affected usage and WOM, while usage did not significantly associate with WOM. Among control variables, only age affects behavioral intention. This study also confirmed the indirect effects and conducted a multi-group analysis (MGA) between students and workers. MGA results show that there are significant differences in three relationships (personalization-satisfaction, utilitarian benefits-WOM, and behavioral intention-WOM) between students and workers. This research extends the understanding of AI tool usage and provides theoretical and practical insights for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers in AI and related fields.",2023,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01919,How does GenAI reinforce higher education students' digital entrepreneurship? The curvilinear roles of perceived digital entrepreneurial desirability and feasibility,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) is reshaping digital entrepreneurship by altering how individuals perceive and pursue new ventures. This study integrates GenAI adoption into the Entrepreneurial Event Model to examine its influence on perceived desirability, feasibility, and entrepreneurial intention. Using stratified random sampling, data from 1061 Vietnamese university students were analyzed via polynomial regression and response surface analysis. The findings confirm that both the incorporation and infusion of GenAI enhance entrepreneurial intentions, primarily by increasing desirability and feasibility. Cognitive alignment between desirability and feasibility emerged as critical: intentions peak when both are high and congruent, while misalignment dampens commitment. This study contributes to entrepreneurial intention theory by introducing GenAI as a cognitive trigger and uncovering curvilinear effects in cognitive evaluations. Practical implications underscore the need for AI literacy, the structured integration of AI into entrepreneurship education, and supportive ecosystems for AI-driven startups.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10039,"Awareness, acceptance, and adoption of Gen-AI by K-12 mathematics teachers: An empirical study integrating TAM and TPB","In the 21st century, the variety of instructional media for mathematics has significantly diversified. Generative AI (Gen-AI) is one technology that K-12 teachers can utilize for teaching mathematics. However, as a new instructional medium, Gen-AI presents its own set of usage challenges. Research into the factors influencing mathematics teachers’ usage behavior of Gen-AI is crucial. This study integrates the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), incorporating a factor of AI awareness to explore the determinants of teachers’ usage behavior in employing Gen-AI for mathematics instruction. Data from 230 mathematics teachers who agreed to participate were analyzed using the partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) approach. The results indicate that teachers’ attitudes toward Gen-AI, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control (PBC) have a direct effect on mathematics teachers’ usage behavior. AI awareness was found to directly affect perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), and attitudes, and it also has an indirect effect on mathematics teachers’ usage behavior. This research provides new insights into enhancing the adoption of Gen-AI as an instructional medium by improving mathematics teachers’ attitudes toward Gen-AI, with AI awareness playing a pivotal role in this enhancement.

REC_12769,"Opting Out of AI: exploring perceptions, reasons, and concerns behind faculty resistance to generative AI","Research on Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) in higher education primarily focuses on faculty use and experiences, with limited attention given to why some abstain from using it. Drawing from Innovation Resistance Theory, this study aims to address this gap by exploring the perceptions of both faculty users and non-users of GAI, identifying the reasons and concerns why they avoid GAI. A survey of 294 full-time higher education faculty from two mid-size U.S. public universities was conducted. Using qualitative and quantitative analysis, results show that over one-third of the faculty members opted out of using GAI for five primary reasons: not ready/not now, no perceived value, identity in tension, threat to human intelligence, and future fears and present risks. While both groups expressed concerns about academic dishonesty, non-users associate GAI with broader negative societal consequences, whereas users viewed it as related to innovation and potential benefits. For non-users, top concerns included a perceived lack of originality and accountability, while users were primarily concerned with accuracy. Surprisingly, general comfort with technology emerged as a significant predictor of non-user faculty's behavioral intention to use GAI. This research contributes to understanding faculty resistance to GAI, emphasizing the need to balance its benefits with drawbacks in higher education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05243,Modeling students’ perceptions of artificial intelligence assisted language learning,"To address the emerging trend of language learning with Artificial Intelligence (AI), this study explored junior and senior high school students’ behavioral intentions to use AI in second language (L2) learning, and the roles of related technological, social, and motivational factors. An eight-factor survey was constructed using a 5-point Likert scale. A total of 524 valid responses were collected, including 280 responses from junior high school students and 244 from senior high school students. The reliability and validity of the scale were satisfactory. The technological and social factors include effort expectancy, performance expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions of AI-assisted language learning (AILL), which were hypothesized to predict students’ behavioral intention to use AILL with reference to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. The motivational factors derived from L2 Motivational Self System theory (i.e. learning experience with AI, cultural interest with AI, and instrumentality-promotion with AI) were hypothesized to be intermediate variables between the technological and social factors and behavioral intention based on the extended UTAUT (UTAUT2). Therefore, UTAUT and the L2 Self System were combined according to UTAUT2 to construct the proposed model in this study, named AILL-Motivation-UTAUT model. The results of the structural equation models of AILL-Motivation-UTAUT showed that performance expectancy, cultural interest, and instrumentality-promotion could predict students’ behavioral intention to use AILL for both junior and senior high students; effort expectancy and social influence could predict behavioral intention to use AILL only for junior high students, learning experience with AI could predict behavioral intention to use AILL only for senior high students, while facilitating conditions could not predict behavioral intention to use AILL for either group. The predictive power (80% for senior high students and 74% for junior high students) of the AILL-Motivation-UTAUT model in this research is higher than or equal to that of UTAUT2 (74%). In addition, this study found that the technological and social factors perceived by students would predict the motivation in AILL. The model verified in this study may inform future studies on AI integration for English as foreign language learning.

REC_03992,Understanding human-AI trust in education,"As AI chatbots become integrated in education, students are turning to these systems for guidance, feedback, and information. However, the anthropomorphic characteristics of these chatbots create ambiguity over whether students develop trust in them in ways similar to trusting a human peer or instructor (human-like trust, often linked to interpersonal trust models) or in ways similar to trusting a conventional technology (system-like trust, often linked to technology trust models). This ambiguity presents theoretical challenges, as interpersonal trust models may inappropriately ascribe human intentionality and morality to AI, while technology trust models were developed for non-social systems, leaving their applicability to conversational, human-like agents unclear. To address this gap, we examine how these two forms of trust, human-like and system-like, comparatively influence students' perceptions of an AI chatbot, specifically perceived enjoyment, trusting intention, behavioral intention to use, and perceived usefulness. Using partial least squares structural equation modeling, we found that both forms of trust significantly influenced student perceptions, though with varied effects. Human-like trust was the stronger predictor of trusting intention, whereas system-like trust more strongly influenced behavioral intention and perceived usefulness; both had similar effects on perceived enjoyment. The results suggest that interactions with AI chatbots give rise to a distinct form of trust, human-AI trust, that differs from human-human and human-technology models, highlighting the need for new theoretical frameworks in this domain. In addition, the study offers practical insights for fostering appropriately calibrated trust, which is critical for the effective adoption and pedagogical impact of AI in education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.47,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05244,Exploring students' acceptance of an artificial intelligence speech evaluation program for EFL speaking practice: an application of the Integrated Model of Technology Acceptance,"Adapted from the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Integrated Model of Technology Acceptance (IMTA) has been used to examine the perceptions and acceptance of computer-assisted language learning (CALL), such as online learning, mobile learning, and learning management systems. However, whether IMTA can be applied to empirical research on AI-assisted language learning remains unexplored. Therefore, this article intends to analyze an AI speech evaluation system for English speaking practice, in the context of higher education through the IMTA. Research instruments encompassed questionnaires (n = 218) and semi-structured interviews (n = 21). The participants were English as a foreign language (EFL) learners who had used an AI speech evaluation program to practice their speaking skills. The results suggested that (1) most participants found the AI program useful, pleasant, and easy to use. They also had a strong intention to continue using it; (2) perceived usefulness (PU) and perceived enjoyment (PE) are significant predictors of behavioural intention to use (BI). Meanwhile, problems related to user interface design, the accuracy of automatic feedback and especially the lack of face-to-face interaction were reported. This study demonstrates how IMTA could be applied to examine users' acceptance of AI programs for EFL speaking practice. The findings also offer insights into further research and development in AI tools for EFL speaking practice.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11724,Using Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict People's Intention to Use Mobile Learning Platforms During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Machine Learning Approach,"Background: Mobile learning has become an essential instruction platform in many schools, colleges, universities, and various other educational institutions across the globe, as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic crisis. The resulting severe, pandemic-related circumstances have disrupted physical and face-to-face contact teaching practices, thereby requiring many students to actively use mobile technologies for learning. Mobile learning technologies offer viable web-based teaching and learning platforms that are accessible to teachers and learners worldwide. Objective: This study investigated the use of mobile learning platforms for instruction purposes in United Arab Emirates higher education institutions. Methods: An extended technology acceptance model and theory of planned behavior model were proposed to analyze university students' adoption of mobile learning platforms for accessing course materials, searching the web for information related to their disciplines, sharing knowledge, and submitting assignments during the COVID-19 pandemic. We collected a total of 1880 questionnaires from different universities in the United Arab Emirates. Partial least squares-structural equation modeling and machine learning algorithms were used to assess the research model, which was based on the data gathered from a student survey. Results: Based on our results, each hypothesized relationship within the research model was supported by our data analysis results. It should also be noted that the J48 classifier (89.37% accuracy) typically performed better than the other classifiers when it came to the prediction of the dependent variable. Conclusions: Our study revealed that teaching and learning could considerably benefit from adopting remote learning systems as educational tools during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the value of such systems could be lessened because of the emotions that students experience, including a fear of poor grades, stress resulting from family circumstances, and sadness resulting from a loss of friends. Accordingly, these issues can only be resolved by evaluating the emotions of students during the pandemic.",2021,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01930,Resistance or resilience? University music teachers' active learning intention in response to the emergence of artificial intelligence,"This study examines Chinese university music teachers' responses to AI integration using structural equation modeling (N = 317). Through Conservation of Resources (COR) theory, we investigate relationships between technology impact awareness, job insecurity, proactive personality, and active learning intention. Results reveal a technology impact-job insecurity decoupling effect: technology awareness directly motivates learning ((3 = 0.519, p < 0.001) without triggering job insecurity as mediator. While job insecurity positively influences learning intention ((3 = 0.338, p < 0.001), it does not mediate the technology-learning relationship. Proactive personality moderates the insecurity-learning link ((3 = 0.132, p < 0.001). To explain this decoupling, we propose an art-technology cognitive separation mechanism whereby music teachers perceive AI as an auxiliary tool enhancing rather than threatening their artistic core. These finding challenges traditional assumptions that technological threats necessarily induce occupational anxiety before motivating adaptation. The study extends COR theory to creative professions and suggests institutions should focus on increasing AI awareness through opportunity-framed exposure rather than threat-based messaging, while tailoring support strategies to teachers' personality traits.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12803,Complex thinking and adopting artificial intelligence tools: a study of university students,"In the next 5 years, artificial intelligence (AI) tools are expected to become commonplace in people's lives, especially in their work processes. Therefore, educational institutions feel intrinsically responsible for ensuring that their students acquire and develop competences associated with the appropriate use of this technology in their educational programs. However, what are the perceptions of students regarding the inclusion of artificial intelligence tools in their educational process and future careers, and what competencies can influence a greater adoption of this technology in the classroom? The objective of this article presents the results of an exploratory study in a sample population of students from a technological university in Mexico, in which their perception and openness toward the training and use of artificial intelligence tools for their professions was examined. Their perception of the development of complex thinking and its sub-competencies was evaluated, recognizing that complex thinking is a valuable cognitive skill to face changes in uncertain environments. The methodology of the study consisted of a multivariate descriptive statistical analysis using R software. The results determined a positive correlation between students' perceived improvement in the achievement of complex thinking competence and their perception of the use of AI tools. In conclusion, participants perceived the use of these tools as a feature of their profession, although they questioned whether this knowledge is included in their professional training.

REC_05359,"Data, machine learning, and human domain experts: None is better than their collaboration","Software designers are coming up with tools having machine learning (ML) capabilities integrated into them. Even naive users can build ML-based models for their respective problem domains using these tools. However, a majority of the advanced ML models behave like a black box in the sense that their behavior is not easily interpretable by humans. This lack of human interpretability acts as a hurdle toward acceptance and subsequent deployment of ML-based solutions. This research work is based on an intuitive idea that in an ideal ML-based solution, the provided dataset, the ML model learned using this dataset, and human domain experts must agree in terms of their perception regarding the problem domain. The objective of this work is to propose a framework that first listens to the dataset, the ML model, and human domain experts individually, and then measure the degree of agreement between them. Listening to the dataset refers identifying important characteristics by computing information gain using entropy and Gini index. Listening to the ML model refers interpreting its decision-making behavior by computing variable importance measures. Listening to human experts refers taking feedback in terms of important features as per their perception regarding the problem domain. The task of measuring agreement between dataset, model, and human experts has been modeled as a “two-judges n-participants” rank correlation problem. The proposed approach has been evaluated on a novel problem domain of predicting joining behavior of freshmen students. A positive degree of agreement was observed between the dataset, the ML model, and human experts in terms of their perception regarding the problem domain. The agreement between the provided dataset, the learned model, and human domain experts helps verify learning acquired by the ML model against the prevailing domain knowledge. This work has the potential to form the basis for developing formal quantitative metrics for evaluating ML models in terms of reliable learning and capability to facilitate trust of human users.

REC_05363,Trust in AI and Its Role in the Acceptance of AI Technologies,"As AI-enhanced technologies become common in a variety of domains, there is an increasing need to define and examine the trust that users have in such technologies. Given the progress in the development of AI, a correspondingly sophisticated understanding of trust in the technology is required. This paper addresses this need by explaining the role of trust in the intention to use AI technologies. Study 1 examined the role of trust in the use of AI voice assistants based on survey responses from college students. A path analysis confirmed that trust had a significant effect the on intention to use AI, which operated through perceived usefulness and participants' attitude toward voice assistants. In Study 2, using data from a representative sample of the U.S. population, different dimensions of trust were examined using exploratory factor analysis, which yielded two dimensions: human-like trust and functionality trust. The results of the path analyses from Study 1 were replicated in Study 2, confirming the indirect effect of trust and the effects of perceived usefulness, ease of use, and attitude on intention to use. Further, both dimensions of trust shared a similar pattern of effects within the model, with functionality-related trust exhibiting a greater total impact on usage intention than human-like trust. Overall, the role of trust in the acceptance of AI technologies was significant across both studies. This research contributes to the advancement and application of the TAM in AI-related applications and offers a multidimensional measure of trust that can be utilized in the future study of trustworthy AI.",2023,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.2,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10089,How understanding the limitations and risks of using ChatGPT can contribute to willingness to use,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) holds promise for enhancing the educational experience by providing personalized feedback and interactive simulations. While its integration into classrooms would improve education, concerns about how students may use AI in the class has prompted research on the perceptions related to the intention to implement GAI, such as perceived benefits, limitations and associated risks in teaching and learning practices. This study examines the perceptions of GAI among 366 students in the United Arab Emirates based on survey results. To do that, initially factor analysis was utilized to identify the relevant scales, followed by comparing the mean values for each scale based on the extent of agreement with the statement regarding students' willingness to use ChatGPT. The study revealed a high awareness among respondents regarding the benefits, limitations, and risks of using ChatGPT. The research confirms that awareness of potential benefits is related to the intention to use ChatGPT in the future. Contrary to expectations, a positive relationship was found between awareness of limitations and the intention to use ChatGPT, challenging traditional views that limitations act as barriers. Similarly, awareness of risks is positively related to the willingness to use ChatGPT, suggesting a nuanced relationship between risk perception and technology adoption in education.The current study provides new insights into the importance of informing individuals about the limitations and risks of ChatGPT, in addition to its benefits, as these factors are closely related to making a positive decision regarding its further usage.",2024,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12807,"ChatGPT usage and attitudes are driven by perceptions of usefulness, ease of use, risks, and psycho-social impact: a study among university students in the UAE","Background The use of ChatGPT among university students has gained a recent popularity. The current study aimed to assess the factors driving the attitude and usage of ChatGPT as an example of generative artificial intelligence (genAI) among university students in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).Methods This cross-sectional study was based on a previously validated Technology Acceptance Model (TAM)-based survey instrument termed TAME-ChatGPT. The self-administered e-survey was distributed by emails for students enrolled in UAE universities during September-December 2023 using a convenience-based approach. Assessment of the demographic and academic variables, and the TAME-ChatGPT constructs' roles in ChatGPT attitude and usage was conducted using univariate followed by multivariate analyses.Results The final study sample comprised 608 participants, 91.0% of whom heard of ChatGPT while 85.4% used ChatGPT before the study. Univariate analysis indicated that a positive attitude to ChatGPT was associated with the three TAME-ChatGPT attitude constructs namely, lower perceived risks, lower anxiety, and higher scores on the attitude to technology/social influence. For the ChatGPT usage, univariate analysis indicated that positive attitude to ChatGPT use was associated with being male, Arab in nationality, and lower point grade average (GPA) as well as the four ChatGPT usage constructs namely, higher perceived usefulness, lower perceived risks of use, higher scores on the behavior/cognitive construct and higher scores on the ease-of-use construct. In multivariate analysis, only TAME-ChatGPT constructs explained the variance in attitude towards ChatGPT (80.8%) and its usage (76.9%).Conclusion The findings indicated that ChatGPT usage is commonplace among university students in the UAE. The determinants of use included the perceived usefulness, lower perceived risks, cognitive and behavioral factors, perceived ease of use, while the attitude was determined by lower perceived risks, lower anxiety, and higher scores for attitude to technology/social influence. These factors should be considered for understanding the motivators for successful adoption of genAI including ChatGPT in higher education.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10091,Disciplinary differences in undergraduate students' engagement with generative artificial intelligence,"The rapid development of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies has sparked widespread discussions about their potential applications in higher education. However, little is known about how students from various disciplines engage with GenAI tools. This study explores undergraduate students' GenAI knowledge, usage intentions, and task-specific engagement across academic disciplines. Using a disciplinary categorization framework, we examine how the hard/soft and pure/applied dimensions relate to students' interactions with GenAI. We surveyed 193 undergraduates from diverse disciplines at a university in Singapore. The questionnaire assessed students' GenAI knowledge, usage intentions, and engagement with GenAI for cognitive and routine tasks against their disciplinary background. The results indicate substantial disciplinary disparities in the level of engagement of students with GenAI. Compared to pure fields, applied fields (both hard and soft) consistently exhibit higher levels of GenAI knowledge and utilization intentions. Furthermore, the engagement of GenAI in routine tasks is relatively consistent across disciplines; however, there are substantial disparities in cognitive tasks, with applied fields exhibiting higher engagement. These results suggest that the practical orientation of applied fields drives GenAI adoption and utilization in academic settings. The study emphasizes considering disciplinary differences to better integrate GenAI into higher education and calls for tailored approaches that align with each field's unique epistemological and methodological traditions to balance GenAI's practical benefits with the preservation of core disciplinary knowledge and skills.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

We administered a research survey to 562 undergraduates (convenient sampling) with disabilities across five Chinese provinces and tested a moderated-mediation model based on Self-determination theory (SDT) using Smart_PLS. Findings show that teacher AI scaffolding exerts a small but significant direct impact on the readiness of students to use academic Chatbots (beta = 0.12, p < .01). The majority of its effects work through two mediators: perceived Chatbot pedagogical intelligence (a competence-related perception; indirect 95 % confidence intervalCI 0.08 to 0.12) and digital self-regulated learning (an autonomy-related behavior; indirect 95 % CI 0.10 to 0.16), both with 95 % CIs (non-zero). Additionally, the strength of these indirect pathways is considerably heightened by increased EdTech media immersion (students' exposure to educational technology), whereby the route via competence (interaction effect 0 0.03, p < .01) and the route via self-regulation (interaction effect 0 0.06, p < .05) increase with higher media immersion. These results are consistent with SDT, which suggests that teacher support facilitates the fulfillment of the basic needs that lead to the adoption of technology. To increase the acceptance of Chatbots by students with special needs, we encourage the use of inclusive education programs that use teacher-guided AI scaffolding. The educational policy ought to be based on training teachers in AIenhanced learning and student data protection, following the latest national recommendations on AI in education in China. This study contributes to theory by integrating motivational mediators and a media context moderator to explain AI readiness (49 % variance explained), and offers practical guidance for leveraging AI in special education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01936,Understanding Chinese university students' continued learning intentions with DeepSeek: An Integrated TAM-SOR model,"Background: DeepSeek has the potential to drive the modernisation of higher education in China. As the primary beneficiaries of higher education, university students are transitioning from traditional learning methods to intelligent learning methods. However, current research in the field of educational artificial intelligence remains excessively focused on rational dimensions such as knowledge transmission, intelligent assessment, and personalised learning, while significantly neglecting emotional perception and sustained learning motivation - factors that are crucial to the learning process of university students . Method: We combined the Technology Acceptance Model with the Stimulus-Organism-Response model to analyse the emotional perceptions influencing their use of DeepSeek as a learning tool. This study collected 476 valid responses through an online questionnaire survey. Conclusions: This study reveals the pivotal role played by perceived emotions and sustained motivation in university students' adoption of generative artificial intelligence learning technologies. The findings indicate that students' perceptions of tool convenience not only enhance evaluations of practicality and usability but also stimulate positive emotional experiences-designs aligned with learning habits enhance a sense of control and pleasure, becoming the core drivers for sustained use. Students with high self-efficacy demonstrate unique advantages, as they can establish an emotional connection between the tool's functions and their personal needs, forming the belief that 'I can use the technology effectively,' thereby effectively reducing usage barriers. This helps to understand the key factors influencing university students' sustained adoption of learning technologies and reduces perceived barriers to the adoption of generative AI learning platforms among university students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10093,Investigating continuous intention to use metaverse in higher education institutions: a dual-staged structural equation modeling-artificial neural network approach,"The current study explores metaverse adoption among higher education institutions (HEIs) in the light of a theoretical framework to empower future perspectives of the metaverse as a learning platform. Even though this technology was just recently introduced to the higher education sector, very few attempts have been made to evaluate its impact. The purpose of this research is to analyze the elements that influence the continuous intention (CI) to utilize the metaverse technology in learning. The technology acceptance model (TAM) and the self-determination theory (SDT) are both included in this study. A questionnaire was developed and distributed to students attending private universities in order to obtain the data that was needed for the proposed model. Using a hybrid approach that consists of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and an artificial neural network (ANN) model, which combines a linear PLS model with compensation and a nonlinear ANN model without compensation, the effect of CI on using the metaverse as a learning platform is investigated. This approach was chosen because it contains both of these types of models. When it comes to explaining the use of metaverse technology among students attending higher education institutions in Egypt, the research findings suggested that autonomy and perceived usefulness (PU) are major determinants. Nevertheless, the continuing intention was unaffected by the perceived ease of use (PEOU) of the product. Furthermore, according to the data provided by the ANN model, the most significant predictors are relatedness, PEOU, autonomy, and PU. It has been determined that the results obtained from the PLS-SEM and ANN modes are identical. Additionally, both theoretical and practical implications are discussed in this article.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.58,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12812,Artificial intelligence for higher education: benefits and challenges for pre-service teachers,"Introduction The study investigates the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education (HE) and its impact on pre-service teachers at the University of Latvia (UL) by exploring pre-service teachers' perceptions of the benefits and challenges of AI in both their academic learning and their future professional roles as educators, particularly regarding the promotion of inclusive education.Methods Data was collected via an online survey of 240 pre-service teachers across various disciplines at the UL. The survey included demographic details, AI usage patterns, and perceived benefits and challenges. Responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics, Kruskal-Wallis H tests, Spearman's correlation, and thematic analysis.Results Less than half of the participants used AI in their studies, with many expressing ambivalence or opposition toward AI. Benefits included language assistance and accessibility to global knowledge, while challenges involved reduced critical thinking and concerns over plagiarism. Despite recognizing AI's potential to promote inclusivity, most pre-service teachers have not applied it in practice. No significant differences in AI perceptions were found based on age, gender, or study level.Discussion The findings highlight a low adoption rate of AI among pre-service teachers and a gap between theoretical recognition of AI's potential and its practical application, particularly for inclusion. The study emphasizes the need for HE institutions to enhance AI literacy and readiness among future teachers.Conclusion AI is underutilized by pre-service teachers in both HE learning and teaching environments, which has implications for teacher preparation programs that better integrate AI literacy and inclusive practices.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01937,Acceptance of AI tools and its impact on communication strategies and vocabulary adaptation: Evidence from Vietnamese English majors,"The rapid development of artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT and Grammarly has changed the way students practice, interact with, and develop English skills, especially for English majors in Vietnam. These tools, with the capacity of providing instant feedback, suggesting alternative wording, and even simulating real conversations, have made them become valuable resources for both classroom and independent learning. Understanding how students approach and use these tools - especially in relation to communication strategies and vocabulary acquisition - is more important than ever as they are increasingly integrated into educational environments. The current study employed a mixed-methods explanatory sequential approach with English majors at a private Vietnamese university in the Mekong Delta. The study participants were 267 surveyed students, of which 12 respondents willingly participated in semi-structured interviews. Quantitative analyses showed robust correlations among PU, ATU, and AIU, and AIU significantly predicted CSC, VLS, VKS-R, and VKS-MR. The qualitative analysis found that adaptive strategies, including prompting, language switching, vocabulary filtering, repetition, and the purposeful use of new words, were connected to gains in vocabulary, learning strategies, communication abilities, and overall learning success. The study finds that AI tools significantly improve English majors' communication strategies and vocabulary development, offering practical insights for teachers, curriculum designers, and AI developers to support technology-driven, learner-focused language education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10094,"Language learners' surface, deep, and organizing approaches to ChatGPT-assisted language learning: What contextual, individual, and ChatGPT-related factors contribute?","Researchers have significantly explored language learners' attitudes toward ChatGPT through the lens of technology acceptance models, particularly with its development and integration into computer-assisted language learning (CALL). However, further research in this area is necessary to apply a theoretical framework with a pedagogical-oriented perspective. Therefore, in this study, the researchers utilized students' approaches to the learning environment (SAL) and extended it by incorporating a multilevel perspective that encompasses contextual, individual, and ChatGPT-related factors. Accordingly, the researchers integrated ChatGPT into their language syllabus and guided learners in three universities in Ardabil City to use ChatGPT during the academic year 2023-2024. In the end, 214 participants answered the study questionnaire. The result of the partial least squares modeling (PLS-SEM), and Importance performance map analysis (IPMA) showed that ChatGPT leadership, where the university executive provides the atmosphere for the norms of ChatGPT integration, could significantly shape language learners' organizing approach to using it in their daily academic schedule. Additionally, personalization and anthropomorphism were among the significant ChatGPT-related factors that shaped learners' deep approach to using ChatGPT as a source for meaningful, cross-referenced CALL tool. However, low feedback reliability, privacy concerns, and the ChatGPT's perceived value contributed to language learners' surface approach to minimizing its use as a ChaGPT-related factor. On the basis of these findings, the study introduces a new conceptual framework for CALL and artificial intelligence language learning (AILL) and suggests that ChatGPT leadership should be promoted at a macro-contextual level that might cover other micro-contextual, personal, and ChatGPT-related factors, including ChatGPT's price-value, personalization, and language learners' motivation, which are important elements to shape learners' approaches to CHAGPTALL.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01938,Digital drivers: How the acceptance and use of technology model shapes university students' behavior toward generative AI,"This study explores the adoption of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) among university students in Saudi Arabia through the lens of the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT). Specifically, it examines how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, attitude toward GenAI, and perceived risk relate to usage behavior. The study also investigates the mediating role of behavioral intention and the moderating effects of age, gender, and AI familiarity. A quantitative survey of 742 students was conducted, and the data were analyzed using bifactor exploratory structural equation modeling (biESEM). The results revealed that global social influence was the strongest predictor of behavioral intention, followed by attitude toward GenAI, while global expectancy showed no significant effect. Behavioral intention emerged as the most robust predictor of actual usage behavior and significantly mediated the effect of attitude on usage. Attitude toward GenAI also had a direct effect on usage behavior, underscoring the importance of cognitive and emotional engagement. Other indirect effects, including those from global expectancy, global social, and perceived risk, were not significant. Moderation analysis showed that only age had a significant but small influence on behavioral intention, while gender and familiarity with GenAI had no significant moderating effects. These findings highlight the central role of social validation and attitudinal commitment in shaping students' engagement with GenAI, offering practical and theoretical implications for technology adoption in higher education contexts. The findings highlight the critical role of social support and positive attitudes in promoting GenAI adoption in educational settings, and the paper concludes with implications for both research and pedagogical practice.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12818,Modeling the influence of AI dependence to research productivity among STEM undergraduate students: case of a state university in the Philippines,"STEM fields-Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics-play crucial roles in advancing knowledge, driving innovation, and addressing challenges by means of several mechanisms including research. Consequently, STEM curricula in higher education institutions prepare undergraduate students taking these fields to engage and produce quality research outputs in preparation for their future careers or roles. The advent of several educational resources help these students to perform research-related tasks including artificial intelligence. Although AI use is viewed as inappropriate in doing scholarly works due to concerns about academic integrity and the fear of losing essential cognitive skills, the growing AI dependence among STEM undergraduate students is inevitable. In this regard, the present study seeks to empirically investigate the influence AI dependence toward students' research productivity, and the mediating roles of research skills, disposition, and self-efficacy. Through literature review, a structural model was proposed and validated. Initially, a research instrument was developed reflective of the constructs present in the structural model where items were also generated using literature review. Eventually, an online survey was conducted and recorded 834 valid responses from STEM undergraduate students. Results revealed that from seven hypotheses proposed in the structural model, six are supported except the causal path between AI dependence and research productivity. The paths between AI dependence to research skills, dispositions, and self-efficacy are supported as well as the paths between these three to research productivity. This indicates the mediation of research skills, dispositions, and self-efficacy between the causal path linking AI dependence to research productivity. The findings of this study imply that strategic integration of AI resources may foster not only skills development but also research motivation and confidence, which together could enhance students' overall research productivity in STEM fields.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01943,University students' learning intention towards generative art in higher education: A SEM-ANN study of human-AI co-creation factors,"The pervasive implementation of generative AI technology in art and design has made exploring students' learning intentions towards generative art a pivotal research topic in higher education. This study aims to explore the factors influencing university students' intention to learn generative art, providing a theoretical basis for teaching reform. A combination of Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) hybrid analysis was employed to analyse data from 556 valid questionnaires collected from 58 Chinese universities with art and design programs. A multi-dimensional factor prediction model was constructed, incorporating Cognitive Expectancy (CE), Learning Expectancy (LE), Social Context Influence (SCI), Affective Motivation (AM), Human-AI Co-creation Experience (HACE), and Ethical Responsibility Awareness (ERA). The findings indicate that AM and HACE exert the most significant influence on students' learning intention, with normalized relative importance values of 100 % and 91.6 %, respectively. This is followed by ERA (81.5 %), LE (77.7 %), CE (77.6 %), and SCI (76.9 %). The model's R2 value is 66.3 %, and its Q2 value is 0.657, indicating strong predictive power. The findings provide theoretical guidance and practical insights for generative art education, suggesting that teaching should focus on affective motivation and human-AI co-creation experience while integrating ethical responsibility education.

The scale is designed to scrutinize students' acceptance of generative artificial intelligence (AI) applications. This tool assesses students' acceptance levels toward generative AI applications. The scale development study was conducted in three phases, encompassing 627 university students from various faculties who have utilized generative AI tools such as ChatGPT during the 2022-2023 academic year. To evaluate the face and content validity of the scale, input was sought from professionals with expertise in the field. The initial sample group (n = 338) underwent exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to explore the underlying factors, while the subsequent sample group (n = 250) underwent confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) for the verification of factor structure. Later, it was seen that four factors comprising 20 items accounted for 78.349% of total variance due to EFA. CFA results confirmed that structure of the scale, featuring 20 items and four factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, and social influence), was compatible with the obtained data. Reliability analysis yielded Cronbach's alpha coefficient of 0.97, and the test-retest method demonstrated a reliability coefficient of 0.95. To evaluate the discriminative power of the items, a comparative analysis was conducted between the lower 27% and upper 27% of participants, with subsequent calculation of corrected item-total correlations.

REC_11799,"AI Education for Fourth-Year Medical Students: Two-Year Experience of a Web-Based, Self-Guided Curriculum and Mixed Methods Study","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) are poised to have a substantial impact in the health care space. While a plethora of web -based resources exist to teach programming skills and ML model development, there are few introductory curricula specifically tailored to medical students without a background in data science or programming. Programs that do exist are often restricted to a specific specialty. Objective: We hypothesized that a 1 -month elective for fourth -year medical students, composed of high -quality existing web -based resources and a project -based structure, would empower students to learn about the impact of AI and ML in their chosen specialty and begin contributing to innovation in their field of interest. This study aims to evaluate the success of this elective in improving self -reported confidence scores in AI and ML. The authors also share our curriculum with other educators who may be interested in its adoption. Methods: This elective was offered in 2 tracks: technical (for students who were already competent programmers) and nontechnical (with no technical prerequisites, focusing on building a conceptual understanding of AI and ML). Students established a conceptual foundation of knowledge using curated web -based resources and relevant research papers, and were then tasked with completing 3 projects in their chosen specialty: a data set analysis, a literature review, and an AI project proposal. The project -based nature of the elective was designed to be self -guided and flexible to each student's interest area and career goals. Students' success was measured by self -reported confidence in AI and ML skills in pre and postsurveys. Qualitative feedback on students' experiences was also collected. Results: This web -based, self -directed elective was offered on a pass -or -fail basis each month to fourth -year students at Emory University School of Medicine beginning in May 2021. As of June 2022, a total of 19 students had successfully completed the elective, representing a wide range of chosen specialties: diagnostic radiology (n=3), general surgery (n=1), internal medicine (n=5), neurology (n=2), obstetrics and gynecology (n=1), ophthalmology (n=1), orthopedic surgery (n=1), otolaryngology (n=2), pathology (n=2), and pediatrics (n=1). Students' self -reported confidence scores for AI and ML rose by 66% after this 1 -month elective. In qualitative surveys, students overwhelmingly reported enthusiasm and satisfaction with the course and commented that the self -direction and flexibility and the project -based design of the course were essential. Conclusions: Course participants were successful in diving deep into applications of AI in their widely -ranging specialties, produced substantial project deliverables, and generally reported satisfaction with their elective experience. The authors are hopeful that a brief, 1-month investment in AI and ML education during medical school will empower this next generation of physicians to pave the way for AI and ML innovation in health care.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11812,Radiology residents’ perceptions of artificial intelligence: Nationwide cross-sectional survey study,"Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming various fields, with health care, especially diagnostic specialties such as radiology, being a key but controversial battleground. However, there is limited research systematically examining the response of “human intelligence” to AI. Objective: This study aims to comprehend radiologists’ perceptions regarding AI, including their views on its potential to replace them, its usefulness, and their willingness to accept it. We examine the influence of various factors, encompassing demographic characteristics, working status, psychosocial aspects, personal experience, and contextual factors. Methods: Between December 1, 2020, and April 30, 2021, a cross-sectional survey was completed by 3666 radiology residents in China. We used multivariable logistic regression models to examine factors and associations, reporting odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs. Results: In summary, radiology residents generally hold a positive attitude toward AI, with 29.90% (1096/3666) agreeing that AI may reduce the demand for radiologists, 72.80% (2669/3666) believing AI improves disease diagnosis, and 78.18% (2866/3666) feeling that radiologists should embrace AI. Several associated factors, including age, gender, education, region, eye strain, working hours, time spent on medical images, resilience, burnout, AI experience, and perceptions of residency support and stress, significantly influence AI attitudes. For instance, burnout symptoms were associated with greater concerns about AI replacement (OR 1.89; P< .001), less favorable views on AI usefulness (OR 0.77; P = .005), and reduced willingness to use AI (OR 0.71; P< .001). Moreover, after adjusting for all other factors, perceived AI replacement (OR 0.81; P< .001) and AI usefulness (OR 5.97; P< .001) were shown to significantly impact the intention to use AI. Conclusions: This study profiles radiology residents who are accepting of AI. Our comprehensive findings provide insights for a multidimensional approach to help physicians adapt to AI. Targeted policies, such as digital health care initiatives and medical education, can be developed accordingly.

REC_10126,Acceptance of artificial intelligence among pre-service teachers: a multigroup analysis,"Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the utilization of artificial intelligence (AI)-based educational applications in education. As pre-service teachers' attitudes towards educational technology that utilizes AI have a potential impact on the learning outcomes of their future students, it is essential to know more about pre-service teachers' acceptance of AI. The aims of this study are (1) to discover what factors determine pre-service teachers' intentions to utilize AI-based educational applications and (2) to determine whether gender differences exist within determinants that affect those behavioral intentions. A sample of 452 pre-service teachers (325 female) participated in a survey at one German university. Based on a prominent technology acceptance model, structural equation modeling, measurement invariance, and multigroup analysis were carried out. The results demonstrated that eight out of nine hypotheses were supported; perceived ease of use (& beta; = 0.297***) and perceived usefulness (& beta; = 0.501***) were identified as primary factors predicting pre-service teachers' intention to use AI. Furthermore, the latent mean differences results indicated that two constructs, AI anxiety (z = - 3.217**) and perceived enjoyment (z = 2.556*), were significantly different by gender. In addition, it is noteworthy that the paths from AI anxiety to perceived ease of use (p = 0.018*) and from perceived ease of use to perceived usefulness (p = 0.002**) are moderated by gender. This study confirms the determinants influencing the behavioral intention based on the Technology Acceptance Model 3 of German pre-service teachers to use AI-based applications in education. Furthermore, the results demonstrate how essential it is to address gender-specific aspects in teacher education because there is a high percentage of female pre-service teachers, in general.

REC_10128,Exploring intention of undergraduate students to embrace chatbots: from the vantage point of Lesotho,"The increasing prevalence of Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) technologies has led to a surge in the popularity of AI application tools, particularly chatbots, in various fields, including education. This research explores the factors influencing undergraduate students' inclination to embrace AI application tools, specifically chatbots, for educational purposes. Using an expanded diffusion theory of innovation framework, the study investigates the relationship between relative advantages, compatibility, trialability, perceived trust, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. Using a 7-point scale, a questionnaire was given to 842 undergraduate students to collect data. The analysis, conducted using SmartPLS 4.0.9.2 software with a covariance-based structural equation model, produced significant findings. The study confirms hypotheses related to the relative advantages, compatibility, trialability, perceived usefulness, and perceived trust associated with chatbots. Notably, students who perceive the benefits of chatbots show a strong intention to use them for academic purposes. The perception of compatibility between students and chatbots positively influences adoption intention, highlighting the importance of compatibility. Additionally, students who have the opportunity to trial chatbots are more likely to use them, emphasizing the significance of trialability. Interestingly, the study did not establish direct relationships between perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and behavioral intention. This suggests the presence of other influential factors or dynamics in the adoption of chatbots for educational purposes.

REC_11813,Assessing Health Students' Attitudes and Usage of ChatGPT in Jordan: Validation Study,"Background: ChatGPT is a conversational large language model that has the potential to revolutionize knowledge acquisition. However, the impact of this technology on the quality of education is still unknown considering the risks and concerns surrounding ChatGPT use. Therefore, it is necessary to assess the usability and acceptability of this promising tool. As an innovative technology, the intention to use ChatGPT can be studied in the context of the technology acceptance model (TAM).Objective: This study aimed to develop and validate a TAM-based survey instrument called TAME-ChatGPT (Technology Acceptance Model Edited to Assess ChatGPT Adoption) that could be employed to examine the successful integration and use of ChatGPT in health care education.Methods: The survey tool was created based on the TAM framework. It comprised 13 items for participants who heard of ChatGPT but did not use it and 23 items for participants who used ChatGPT. Using a convenient sampling approach, the survey link was circulated electronically among university students between February and March 2023. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) was used to assess the construct validity of the survey instrument.Results: The final sample comprised 458 respondents, the majority among them undergraduate students (n=442, 96.5%). Only 109 (23.8%) respondents had heard of ChatGPT prior to participation and only 55 (11.3%) self-reported ChatGPT use before the study. EFA analysis on the attitude and usage scales showed significant Bartlett tests of sphericity scores (P<.001) and adequate Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measures (0.823 for the attitude scale and 0.702 for the usage scale), confirming the factorability of the correlation matrices. The EFA showed that 3 constructs explained a cumulative total of 69.3% variance in the attitude scale, and these subscales represented perceived risks, attitude to technology/social influence, and anxiety. For the ChatGPT usage scale,EFA showed that 4 constructs explained a cumulative total of 72% variance in the data and comprised the perceived usefulness, perceived risks, perceived ease of use, and behavior/cognitive factors. All the ChatGPT attitude and usage subscales showed good reliability with Cronbach alpha values >.78 for all the deduced subscales.Conclusions: The TAME-ChatGPT demonstrated good reliability, validity, and usefulness in assessing health care students' attitudes toward ChatGPT. The findings highlighted the importance of considering risk perceptions, usefulness, ease of use, attitudes toward technology, and behavioral factors when adopting ChatGPT as a tool in health care education. This information can aid the stakeholders in creating strategies to support the optimal and ethical use of ChatGPT and to identify the potential challenges hindering its successful implementation.

REC_05395,Exploring the Perceptions and Continuance Intention of AI-Based Text-to-Image Technology in Supporting Design Ideation,"Artificial intelligence (AI)-based text-to-image technologies have recently gained considerable attention, but their specific applications for educational purposes remain relatively unexplored. This research aims to bridge this gap by developing a theoretical model that combines constructs from the Expectation Confirmation Model (ECM) with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) to understand the sustainable use of AI-driven visual synthesis in design ideation. Data was collected via a survey involving 106 vocational university students who were enrolled in a user interface (UI) design course to test the proposed model. The hypotheses analysis demonstrated that confirmation positively influenced perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and satisfaction. Furthermore, perceived usefulness had a positive impact on satisfaction. Students' perceptions of the utility, usability, and satisfaction of AI-driven visual synthesis also positively affected their intention to continue using the technology. However, the hypothesis proposing a positive relationship between perceived ease of use and user satisfaction did not find support. A moderation analysis revealed that novice design students were susceptible to effort expectancy, negatively affecting their satisfaction with the technology. These findings offer valuable practical implications for developers, designers, and instructors interested in utilizing AI-driven visual synthesis for educational purposes in UI design.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

An Ethical Perspective","The study aims to explore the factors that influence university students' behavioral intention (BI) and use behavior (UB) of generative AI products from an ethical perspective. Referring to ethical decision-making theory, the research model extends the UTAUT2 model with three influencing factors: ethical awareness (EA), perceived ethical risks (PER), and AI ethical anxiety (AIEA). A sample of 226 university students was analysed using the Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling technique (PLS-SEM). The research results further validate the effectiveness of UTAUT2. Furthermore, performance expectancy, hedonistic motivation, price value, and social influence all positively influence university students' BI to use generative AI products, except for effort expectancy. Facilitating conditions and habit show no significant impact on BI, but they can determine UB. The three extended factors from the ethical perspective play significant roles as well. AIEA and PER are not key determinants of BI. However, AIEA can directly inhibit UB. From the mediation analysis, although PER do not have a direct impact on UB, it inhibits UB indirectly through AIEA. Ethical awareness can positively influence BI. Nevertheless, it can also increase PER.

REC_02035,Adoption of chatgpt in educational institutions in Botswana: A customer perspective,"This research aims to examine the factors influencing the adoption of ChatGPT in educational institutions in Botswana. It addresses three major gaps. The first is the lack of research on AI adoption for teaching and learning in developing countries, particularly Botswana. While AI adoption in education has been studied globally, there is little understanding of how tools such as ChatGPT and Jenni AI are perceived in this context. Second, there is a lack of research on the infrastructure and digital disparities that developing countries face when integrating AI in education, especially in rural areas. Third, the use of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) 2 in studying AI adoption in educational settings in low-resource countries remains underexplored. This study employed a quantitative design, collecting data from 518 participants through online questionnaires using a snowball sampling technique. The data were analysed using confirmatory factor analysis in SmartPLS 3.0 software in order to ensure internal consistency and validity. The findings revealed that personal innovativeness and performance expectancy were the strongest predictors of ChatGPT adoption, while social influence and resource availability had less impact. The model explained over 50% of the variance in behavioural intention and usage behaviour. The research highlights the need for training and infrastructure improvements to support AI adoption in Botswana's higher education.

REC_12836,From threat perception to use hesitancy: examining college students' psychological barriers to generative AI adoption,"The usefulness and ease of use of generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technology serve as the necessary technical foundation for its rapid proliferation. However, within the current educational landscape, students have raised growing concerns and apprehensions regarding the ethical governance of GAI technologies and their potential to disrupt employment opportunities through job displacement effects. This study investigated the relationship between perceptions of threats and hesitancy concerning the use of GAI technology among college students. A survey of 805 participants revealed a positive correlation between perceived technological threat and use hesitancy. Importantly, perceived avoidability and fear of GAI were found to serve as sequential mediators in this relationship. These findings elucidate the psychological mechanisms that underlie students' reluctance to adopt emerging GAI technologies and suggest that interventions aimed at addressing threat perceptions, increasing avoidability, and reducing fear may promote greater acceptance of such techniques among students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_10136,Integrating AI in higher education: factors influencing ChatGPT acceptance among Chinese university EFL students,"This study explores how Chinese university EFL learners accept and utilise ChatGPT, employing the widely recognised UTAUT2 model. A quantitative approach was utilised, collecting data from 340 participants through an online questionnaire and analysing it using structural equation modelling (SEM). The results indicate that habitual behaviour considerably influences students' behavioural intentions (BI) and actual use behaviour (UB), underscoring the importance of fostering regular engagement with ChatGPT. Performance expectancy and social influence also positively impact BI, whereas hedonic motivation, effort expectancy, and price value show non-significant effects. Interestingly, facilitating conditions exert a significant influence on actual use behaviour, despite their weak influence on BI. The study contrasts with prior research by highlighting the minimal impact of behavioural intention on actual use, suggesting that habit and supporting resources are more critical in this context.

REC_02078,"Adoption of ChatGPT by university students for academic purposes: Partial least square, artificial neural network, deep neural network and classification algorithms approach","Given the limited extent of study conducted on the application of ChatGPT in the realm of education, this domain still needs to be explored. Consequently, the primary objective of this study is to evaluate the impact of factors within the extended value-based adoption model (VAM) and to delineate the individual contributions of these factors toward shaping the attitudes of university students regarding the utilization of ChatGPT for instructional purposes. This investigation incorporates dimensions such as social infiuence, self-efficacy, and personal innovativeness to augment the VAM. This augmentation aims to identify components where a hybrid approach, integrating partial least squares (PLS), artificial neural networks (ANN), deep neural networks (DNN), and classification algorithms, is employed to accurately discern both linear and nonlinear correlations. The data for this study were obtained through an online survey administered to university students, and a purposive sample technique was employed to select 369 valid responses. Following the initial data preparation, the assessment process comprised three successive stages: PLS, ANN, DNN and classification algorithms analysis. Intention is infiuenced by attitude, which is predicted by perceived usefulness, perceived enjoyment, social infiuence, selfefficacy, and personal innovativeness. Moreover, personal innovativeness has the maximum contribution to attitude followed by self-efficacy, enjoyment, usefulness, social infiuence, technicality, and cost. These findings will support the creation and prioritization of student-centered educational services. Additionally, this study can contribute to creating an efficient learning management system to enhance students' academic performance and professional efficiency.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11856,"The impact of performance expectancy, workload, risk, and satisfaction on trust in ChatGPT: Cross-sectional survey analysis","Background: ChatGPT (OpenAI) is a powerful tool for a wide range of tasks, from entertainment and creativity to health care queries. There are potential risks and benefits associated with this technology. In the discourse concerning the deployment of ChatGPT and similar large language models, it is sensible to recommend their use primarily for tasks a human user can execute accurately. As we transition into the subsequent phase of ChatGPT deployment, establishing realistic performance expectations and understanding users' perceptions of risk associated with its use are crucial in determining the successful integration of this artificial intelligence (AI) technology. Objective: The aim of the study is to explore how perceived workload, satisfaction, performance expectancy, and risk-benefit perception influence users' trust in ChatGPT. Methods: A semistructured, web-based survey was conducted with 607 adults in the United States who actively use ChatGPT. The survey questions were adapted from constructs used in various models and theories such as the technology acceptance model, the theory of planned behavior, the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology, and research on trust and security in digital environments. To test our hypotheses and structural model, we used the partial least squares structural equation modeling method, a widely used approach for multivariate analysis. Results: A total of 607 people responded to our survey. A significant portion of the participants held at least a high school diploma (n=204, 33.6%), and the majority had a bachelor's degree (n=262, 43.1%). The primary motivations for participants to use ChatGPT were for acquiring information (n=219, 36.1%), amusement (n=203, 33.4%), and addressing problems (n=135, 22.2%). Some participants used it for health-related inquiries (n=44, 7.2%), while a few others (n=6, 1%) used it for miscellaneous activities such as brainstorming, grammar verification, and blog content creation. Our model explained 64.6% of the variance in trust. Our analysis indicated a significant relationship between (1) workload and satisfaction, (2) trust and satisfaction, (3) performance expectations and trust, and (4) risk-benefit perception and trust. Conclusions: The findings underscore the importance of ensuring user-friendly design and functionality in AI-based applications to reduce workload and enhance user satisfaction, thereby increasing user trust. Future research should further explore the relationship between risk-benefit perception and trust in the context of AI chatbots.

REC_05422,From uncertainty to tenacity: Investigating user strategies and continuance intentions in AI-powered ChatGPT with uncertainty reduction theory,"The introduction of ChatGPT in academia has raised significant concerns, particularly regarding issues like plagiarism and the ethical use of generative text for academic purposes. Existing literature has predominantly focused on ChatGPT adoption, leaving a notable gap in addressing the strategies users employ to mitigate these emerging challenges. To bridge this gap, this research utilizes the Uncertainty Reduction Theory (URT) to formulate user strategies for reducing uncertainty. These strategies include both interactive and passive approaches. Concurrently, the study identifies key sources of uncertainty, which include concerns related to transparency, information accuracy, and privacy. Additionally, it introduces the concepts of seeking clarification and consulting peer feedback as mediating roles to facilitate reduced uncertainty. We tested these hypotheses with a sample of Indonesian users (N = 566) using structural equation modeling via Smart-PLS 4.0 software. The results confirm that interactive Uncertainty Reduction Strategies (URS) are more effective in reducing uncertainty when using ChatGPT compared to passive URS. Transparency concerns, information accuracy, and privacy concerns are identified as factors that increase the level of uncertainty. In contrast, consulting peer feedback is the most effective strategy for reducing uncertainty compared to seeking clarification at the individual-system level. Insights from the mediating effects confirm that consulting peer feedback significantly mediates uncertainty sources to reduce uncertainty. The study discusses various strategies for the ethical use of ChatGPT by users in the educational context and contributes significantly to theoretical development.

REC_10138,The value of GenAI for peer feedback provision: student perceptions and impacts,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) has sparked a global debate on its potential as a feedback source for students, yet research in this area remains limited. This study explores students' use of GenAI during peer feedback provision. Fifty-four graduate students enrolled in a master's course in the food science domain at a Dutch university received instruction on the effective and ethical use of GenAI. They then wrote an argumentative essay, provided feedback to peers, and revised their essays. Finally, students completed an online questionnaire regarding their perceptions and use of GenAI for peer feedback provision. Descriptive analyses were applied to survey data and comment data were coded quantitatively for the presence of comment features. The results revealed that just over half of the students chose not to use GenAI for peer feedback provision, primarily because they believed they would learn more by completing the task independently. The remaining students used GenAI to improve both high-level and low-level aspects of their feedback, and most of these students found GenAI to be moderately helpful for peer feedback provision. In terms of its impact on the peer feedback content, students who used GenAI provided more suggestions for high-level issues and offered less mitigating praise for low-level issues compared to those who did not use GenAI for peer feedback provision. These results offer valuable insights for the design and adoption of GenAI tools to enhance peer feedback practices.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05440,A Comparative Study on AI-Based Learning Behaviors: Evidence from Vietnam,"AI-based learning systems are transforming education in academic and corporate settings, with global spending on AI-enabled training expected to exceed $200 billion by 2025. This study examines how these systems enhance learning outcomes for college students and employees, focusing on system functionality, self-efficacy, familiarity, and social influence. Using structural equation modeling with data from 598 participants (258 students, 340 employees), findings reveal that familiarity positively impacts self-efficacy and learning outcomes across both groups, while social influence varies. Students benefit from media-rich environments, while employees gain from job-relevant content and supervisor influence.

REC_12847,Predicting STEM students' adoption of generative AI in academic contexts: an application of the UTAUT model,"Introduction: The rapid advancement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has created new opportunities and challenges in higher education, particularly in STEM disciplines. Understanding the factors that influence students' behavioral intention to adopt generative AI is essential for effective integration into learning environments. This study applies the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) to examine these factors among STEM students. Methods: A cross-sectional survey was conducted among 464 STEM students at Prince Sattam Bin Abdulaziz University in Saudi Arabia. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the proposed model. Model fit indices indicated good fit (chi(2)/df = 2.94, GFI = 0.92, AGFI = 0.89, RMSEA = 0.056, NFI = 0.91, CFI = 0.94). Results: Performance expectancy (beta = 0.491, p < 0.001), effort expectancy (beta = 0.130, p < 0.001), social influence (beta = 0.239, p < 0.001), and facilitating conditions (beta = 0.213, p < 0.001) significantly predicted behavioral intention to adopt generative AI. Subgroup analyses revealed higher adoption intentions among female students, those with beginner-level computer experience, and students majoring in Engineering and Computer Science. Discussion: The findings highlight the crucial role of perceived usefulness, ease of use, social norms, and institutional support in influencing AI adoption among STEM students. To enhance adoption, the study recommends improving digital infrastructure, providing targeted AI training, and promoting peer-led initiatives. Future research should investigate longitudinal and cross-cultural dynamics of AI adoption in education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

This study fills an important gap in the literature by examining direct and mediated relationships of key constructs such as AI perceived usefulness, AI perceived ease of use, and AI technical competency toward AI chatbot usage. This study aims to investigate students' mindsets regarding adopting AI chatbots for the effectiveness of online learning in higher education. Data were collected from 429 university students and analyzed using the partial least squares-based structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) technique. The results revealed that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU), and tech competency (TC) have a significant impact on AI capability. Subjective norm (SN) has no significant impact on AI chatbot capability. The capability of AI chatbots significantly influences the adoption of AI chatbots for learning effectiveness. The findings indicated that AI chatbot capability mediates the effect of PU, PEU, and TC on the adoption of AI chatbots; however, there is no mediating effect in the relationship between SN and AI chatbot capability. Facilitating conditions moderate the effect of PU and TC on AI chatbot capability.

REC_04684,Generative AI tool use enhances academic achievement in sustainable education through shared metacognition and cognitive offloading among preservice teachers,"The integration of generative artificial intelligence tools in education has emerged as a transformative approach to enhancing learning outcomes, particularly in the context of sustainable development goals (SDG4). Therefore, the present study investigates the connection between generative artificial intelligence tool usage (GenAITU) and academic achievement (AA) in the context of SDG4. We assessed the mediating role of shared metacognition (SMC) and cognitive offloading (COL) in this relationship among preservice teachers (PSTs). The indicators, including performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), facilitating conditions (FC), and use behavior (UB), are derived from adapting the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) for GenAITU. The authors surveyed 465 students from five universities in Wuhan, China, using a 7-point Likert scale through a time-lag design. Statistical analysis was performed through partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), to determine the relationship between variables. Findings indicated that two components of GenAITU, namely PE and UB, showed significant positive associations with AA, while the other two, EE and FC, did not show significant and positive relationships with AA. Results also showed that three dimensions of GenAITU, namely EE, FC, and UB have a positive and significant association with SMC while PE has a positive and significant connection with SMC. All four components of GenAITU like PE, EE, FC, and UB have positive and significant links with COL. SMC and COL have a positive and significant relationship with AA. Results also indicated that SMC mediated the connections between GenAITU (EE, FC, and UB) and AA. Outcomes also indicated that COL mediated the connections between GenAITU (PE, EE, FC, and UB) and AA. The current study shows that SMC and COL were strong mediators of the association between GenAITU and AA.

REC_04685,Modeling teacher education students' adoption of large language models through an extended technology acceptance framework,"With the deepening integration of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies in the education sector, large language models (LLMs) have become essential tools for supporting writing tasks. As the future backbone of the teaching profession, the acceptance of these technologies by teacher education students not only influences their professional development but also plays a critical role in the digital transformation of future educational practices. However, existing research has yet to fully uncover the underlying mechanisms and influencing factors driving technology adoption behaviors within this group. This study extends the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) by incorporating key variables such as learning motivation, perceived risks, self-efficacy, and usage experience. Using structural equation modeling (SEM), we analyzed survey data from 552 fourth-year teacher education students in China to test the proposed hypotheses. The empirical findings reveal that subjective norms are the strongest predictor of behavioral intention, while perceived ease of use significantly and positively influences attitudes toward using LLMs. Among the risk dimensions, perceived time risk exerts a significant negative effect on perceived usefulness, whereas perceived privacy risk negatively impacts perceived ease of use. Additionally, usage experience fosters technology adoption behaviors by enhancing learning motivation. These findings not only extend the application boundaries of the TAM within the field of educational technology but also provide empirical evidence for educational institutions to design technology training programs and for model developers to optimize user experiences. Furthermore, they offer a theoretical framework for building digital literacy training systems for teacher education students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02171,Does intrinsic motivation mediate perceived artificial intelligence (AI) learning and computational thinking of students during the COVID-19 pandemic?,"The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI), born as the possibility of simulating the human brain's learning capabilities, quickly evolves into one of the educational technology concepts that provide tools for students to better themselves in a plethora of areas. Unlike the previous educational technology iterations, which are limited to instrumental use for providing platforms to build learning applications, AI has proposed a unique education laboratory by enabling students to explore an instrument that functions as a dynamic system of computational concepts. However, the extent of the implications of AI adaptation in modern education is yet to be explored. Motivated to fill the literature gap and to consider the emerging significance of AI in education, this paper aims to analyze the possible intertwined relationship between students' intrinsic motivation for learning Artificial Intelligence during the COVID-19 pandemic; the relationship between students' computational thinking and understanding of AI concepts; and the underlying dynamic relation, if existing, between AI and computational thinking building efforts. To investigate the mentioned relationships, the present empirical study employs mediation analysis based upon collected 137 survey data from Universidad Politecnica de Madrid students in the Institute for Educational Science and the School of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering during the first quarter of 2022. Findings show that intrinsic motivation mediates the relationship between perceived Artificial Intelligence learning and computational thinking.

REC_05468,Predicting the actual use of m-learning systems: a comparative approach using PLS-SEM and machine learning algorithms,"Despite the plethora of m-learning acceptance studies, few have tackled the importance of examining the actual use of m-learning systems from the lenses of social influence, expectation-confirmation, and satisfaction. Additionally, most of the prior technology adoption literature tends to use the structural equation modeling (SEM) technique in analyzing the structural models. To address these limitations, this study extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) with the expectation-confirmation model (ECM) and social influence to predict the actual use of m-learning systems. A comparative approach using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and machine learning algorithms was employed to test the proposed model with data collected from 448 students. The results revealed that both techniques have successfully provided support to all the hypothesized relationships of the research model. More interesting, the J48 classifier has performed better than the other classifiers in predicting the dependent variable in most cases. The employment of a comparative analytical approach is believed to add a significant contribution to the information systems (IS) literature in general, and the m-learning domain in specific.",2023,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02173,"Students' use of large language models in engineering education: A case study on technology acceptance, perceptions, efficacy, and detection chances","The accessibility of advanced Artificial Intelligence-based tools, like ChatGPT, has made Large Language Models (LLMs) readily available to students. These LLMs can generate original written content to assist students in their academic assessments. With the rapid adoption of LLMs, exemplified by the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT, there is a growing need to explore their application in education. Few studies examine students' use of LLMs as learning tools. This paper focuses on the application of ChatGPT in engineering higher education through an indepth case study. It investigates whether engineering students can generate high-quality university essays with LLMs assistance, whether existing LLMs identification systems can detect essays produced with LLMs, and how students perceive the usefulness and acceptance of LLMs in learning. The research adopts a deductive/inductive approach, combining conceptualization and empirical evidence analysis. The study involves mechanical and management engineering students, who compose essays using LLMs. The essay assessment showed good results, but some recommendations emerged for teachers and students. Thirteen LLMs detectors were tested without achieving satisfactory results, suggesting to avoid LLMs ban. In addition, students were administered a questionnaire based on constructs and items that follow the technology acceptance models available in the literature. The results contribute to qualitative evidence by highlighting possible future research and educational practices.",2023,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.26,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_05476,Incorporating a reflective thinking promoting mechanism into artificial intelligence-supported English writing environments,"Automated writing feedback supported by artificial intelligence (AI) techniques has attracted the attention of English as Foreign Language (EFL) researchers. However, there is insufficient evidence and inconsistent conclusions on the actual impacts of AI on students’ writing skills. In addition, in the field of EFL writing, there are few studies which have integrated appropriate teaching strategies to promote the effectiveness of EFL writing teaching and learning. Furthermore, it remains unclear how learners can effectively benefit from AI technology-based English writing. To solve this problem, this study proposed a reflective thinking promotion mechanism-based AI-supported English writing (RTP-AIEW) approach to deepen learners’ thinking and improve their EFL writing quality. To investigate the effectiveness of this learning approach, a quasi-experiment was conducted in two EFL writing classes in a university. One class (50 students) was the experimental group learning with the proposed RTP-AIEW approach, while the other class (53 students) was the control group learning with conventional AI-supported EFL writing. The results indicated that the proposed approach not only significantly improved the experimental group students’ English writing performance, but also improved their self-efficacy and self-regulated learning, and significantly reduced their cognitive load. In addition, students’ learning experience and perceptions are also discussed.

REC_02176,Investigating pre-service teachers' artificial intelligence perception from the perspective of planned behavior theory,"There is a need for teachers who are prepared to teach Artificial Intelligence (AI) across the K-12 learning contexts. Owing to the dearth of teacher education programmes on AI, it is helpful to explore factors to be considered in designing an effective AI programme for future teachers. We posit that understanding how to encourage pre-service teachers to learn AI is thus critical for practitioners and policymakers while designing effective instructional AI teacher education programmes. This exploratory study examined the perceptions of pre-service teachers and their behavioral intention to learn AI, by identifying factors that might affect learning and promoting AI in teacher preparation programmes. This study proposed a research model supported by the theory of planned behavior and expanded with other constructs. The factors that were examined include basic knowledge of AI, subjective norm, AI for social good, perceived self-efficacy, self-transcendent goals, personal relevance, AI anxiety, behavioral intention to learn AI, and actual learning of AI. Using a duly validated questionnaire, we surveyed 796 pre-service teachers in Nigerian Universities. Through structural equation modeling approach analyses, our proposed model explains about 79% of the variance in pre-service teachers' intention to learn AI. Basic knowledge and subjective norm were found to be the most important determinant in pre-service teachers' intention to learn AI. All our hypotheses were supported except for self-efficacy and personal relevance, personal relevance and social good, and behavioral intention and actual learning behavior.

REC_05477,"Understanding students' participation of intelligent teaching: an empirical study considering artificial intelligence usefulness, interactive reward, satisfaction, university support and enjoyment","The new era of technologies represented by artificial intelligence is profoundly reconstructing the field of education. The integration of emerging technologies in intelligent teaching provides new approaches for improving teaching effectiveness and enriching learning experiences. Today, we know little about students' participation in intelligent teaching with the help of artificial intelligence. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of students' involvement in intelligent teaching. We designed a questionnaire for the confirmatory model of the participation of intelligent teaching through literature research and content analysis. After modeling and empirical analysis with the help of partial least structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) software (SmartPLS 3.0), we found that: satisfaction, university support, perceived enjoyment, and interactive rewards all indirectly affect intelligent teaching participation through mediating variables (i.e., participation intention and interactivity); participation intention and interactivity directly and positively affect intelligent teaching participation; artificial intelligence usefulness positively moderates the relationships between the two mediating variables (participation intention, interactivity) and intelligent teaching participation. Based on the results of the data analysis, this study offered corresponding optimization strategies: improving students' participation experience in intelligent teaching through using the new technology artificial intelligence; implementing the teaching philosophy of teaching for learning, teaching for fun; applying student-oriented approaches to improve the participation intention.

REC_11917,Exploring the Application Capability of ChatGPT as an Instructor in Skills Education for Dental Medical Students: Randomized Controlled Trial,"Background: Clinical operative skills training is a critical component of preclinical education for dental students. Although technology-assisted instruction, such as virtual reality and simulators, is increasingly being integrated, direct guidance from instructors remains the cornerstone of skill development. ChatGPT, an advanced conversational artificial intelligence model developed by OpenAI, is gradually being used in medical education. Objective: This study aimed to compare the effects of ChatGPT-assisted skill learning on performance, cognitive load, self-efficacy, learning motivation, and spatial ability, with the aim of evaluating the potential of ChatGPT in clinical operative skills education. Methods: In this study, 187 undergraduate dental students recruited from a first-class university in China were randomly divided into a ChatGPT group and a blank control group. Among them, the control group used videos for skill acquisition, and the ChatGPT group used ChatGPT in addition to the videos. After 1 week of intervention, skills were tested using desktop virtual reality, and cognitive load was measured by recording changes in pupil diameter with an eye tracker. In addition, a spatial ability test was administered to analyze the effect of ChatGPT on those with different spatial abilities. Finally, a questionnaire was also used to assess cognitive load and self-efficacy during the learning process. Results: A total of 192 dental undergraduates from atop-tier Chinese university were initially recruited for the experiment by October 25, 2024. Following eye-tracking calibration procedures, 5 participants were excluded, resulting in 187 eligible students successfully completing the experimental protocol by November 2, 2024. Following a short-term intervention administered through randomized allocation, superior performance (ChatGPT group: mean 73.12, SD 10.06; control group: mean 65.54, SD 12.48; P<.001) was observed among participants in the ChatGPT group, along with higher levels of self-efficacy (P=.04) and learning motivation (P=.02). In addition, cognitive load was lower in the ChatGPT group according to eye-tracking measures (ChatGPT group: mean 0.137, SD 0.036; control group: mean 0.312, SD 0.032; P<.001). Theanalysis of the learning performance of participants with different spatial abilities in the 2 modalities showed that compared to the learners with high spatial abilities (ChatGPT group: mean 76.58, SD 9.23; control group: mean 73.89, SD 11.75; P=.22), thosewith low spatial abilities (ChatGPT group: mean 70.20, SD 10.71; control group: mean 55.41, SD 13.31; P<.001) were more positively influenced by ChatGPT. Conclusions: ChatGPT has performed outstandingly in assisting dental skill learning, and the study supports the integration of ChatGPT into skills teaching and provides new ideas for modernizing skill teaching.

REC_04696,AI acceptance and Chinese EFL learners' behavioral engagement with mediating effects of motivation,"As artificial intelligence (AI) technologies become increasingly integrated into education, understanding how they influence learners' engagement is essential for effective pedagogy. This study examines the motivational mechanisms by which Chinese EFL learners' acceptance of AI tools influences their behavioral engagement. Grounded in Self-Determination Theory and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, a cross-sectional survey was conducted among 654 university students. Structural equation modeling revealed that AI acceptance positively predicted motivation (beta = 0.628, p < .001), which in turn significantly predicted engagement (beta = 0.517, p < .001). A direct effect of AI acceptance on engagement (beta = 0.253, p < .001) was also observed. Bootstrap mediation analysis revealed significant indirect effects of AI acceptance on behavioral engagement, particularly via self-satisfaction and self-efficacy. These findings highlight the importance of fostering autonomous motivation to translate positive perceptions of AI into active learning behaviors. The study provides empirical support for the integration of learner-centered AI and suggests that motivationally supportive design and pedagogy are crucial for maximizing AI's educational potential.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

This study explores students' adoption and perceptions of ChatGPT and other AI chatbots in higher education. Based on survey data from a large sample (n = 5894) across Swedish universities, the study employs descriptive statistical methods to analyze usage, attitudes, and concerns, and inferential statistics to identify relations between attitudes and usage and background variables (gender, academic level, and field of study). The results reveal broad awareness and use of ChatGPT among students, but not of other AI chatbots. More than half of the students expressed positive attitudes towards the use of chatbots in education, but almost as many expressed concerns about future use. Statistically significant differences were found across all examined grouping variables, particularly between genders and fields of study. Female students and students from the humanities and medicine consistently expressed more negative attitudes and concerns about AI's role in learning and assessment, while males and technology and engineering students showed higher usage and optimism. These findings not only validate the continued relevance of student backgrounds as a determinant of technology adoption but also expose several challenges and considerations surrounding AI and chatbot usage in education.

REC_13317,"How mindfulness shapes AI competence: a structural equation modeling analysis of mindfulness, AI literacy and behavioral intention in Chinese media students","Introduction Artificial Intelligence (AI) literacy, defined as the knowledge and ability to recognize, apply, and evaluate AI, is a key driving force of digital transformation and technological innovation. In the media industry, the demand for intelligent+ interdisciplinary talent has prompted universities to embed AI literacy training into talent development programs. While curriculum systems have been progressively refined, the challenge remains on how to activate students' intention to embrace and effectively utilize AI. Mindfulness, a metacognitive trait that enhances cognitive flexibility, self-regulation, and creativity, may contribute to the development of AI literacy, although its specific impact in this progress remains largely unexplored.Methods This study constructs the integrated model of Mindfulness-AI Literacy-Technology Application. Survey data were collected from 588 media students in China and analyzed using SPSS and SmartPLS to conduct structural equation modeling. AI literacy is comprised of four dimensions: acknowledgment of AI (AAI), AI ethics (AIE), AI collaboration (AIC), and AI self-efficacy (AIS).Results Mindfulness significantly and positively influenced AAI, AIE, and AIC, but showed no significant relationship with AIS. It also had a significant direct positive effect on AIBI. Furthermore, AAI and AIC partially mediated the relationship between mindfulness and AIBI.Discussion Results confirm that mindfulness is an effective internal pathway for strengthening key AI literacy dimensions and enhancing media students' intention to apply AI technologies.

REC_01476,Unlocking EFL learners' insights into ChatGPT use for L2 writing: The impacts of usage frequency and gender variations,"The emergence of ChatGPT as a powerful chatbot has revolutionized global education in general and language learning in particular since it can offer opportunities for students and teachers. Against this backdrop, this study aimed to explore whether gender and usage frequency affect English learners' perceptions of ChatGPT use in second language (L2) writing beyond the classroom. In accordance with the Technology Acceptance Model (Davis, 1989), this research was conducted at English major departments at a state university in T & uuml;rkiye. Employing a fully integrated mixed methods approach and adopting a sequential explanatory design, the present study recruited 874 Turkish undergraduate students. Quantitative data were collected through the Demographic Information Form and the ChatGPT Perception Scale, whereas qualitative data were gathered through semi-structured interviews. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were performed to assess the reliability and validity of the scale. Descriptive and inferential statistics were run for the quantitative data analysis, while qualitative data were analyzed using thematic analysis. The results revealed that many participants used ChatGPT in second language writing, though rarely, and held positive perceptions of the tool. Gender-based variations were detected in terms of usage frequency but not overall perceptions; furthermore, there was a significant positive correlation between usage frequency and perceptions. Based on the integration of both data sources, contradictory, expanded, and confirmed outcomes emerged, and explicit implications were suggested regarding the use of ChatGPT for L2 writing outside the classroom.",2025,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02181,The rapid rise of generative AI and its implications for academic integrity: Students’ perceptions and use of chatbots for assistance with assessments,"The rapid adoption of generative AI tools such as ChatGPT by students has the potential to disrupt the higher education sector, with concerns being raised by academics about potential threats to academic integrity. This paper contributes to the pressing discussion about responses to AI tools by examining students' perceptions and the use of generative AI to assist them with assessments. Based on a survey among 337 Australian university students, this study found that more than a third of students have used a chatbot for assistance with an assessment, and do not necessarily perceive this as a breach of academic integrity. The study further investigated to what extent different psychosocial factors such as learning motivations, distress or resilience are associated with students’ use of AI chatbots in order to ascertain environmental conditions or risk factors driving their use. Findings suggest that the higher education sector faces the challenge of not only defining clear policies and guidelines about ethical and academically honest ways to use and integrate generative AI tools into university education and assessments, but also to rethink the design of assessment pieces. © 2024",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13761,Examining the Impact of Artificial Intelligence and Social and Computer Anxiety in E-Learning Settings: Students' Perceptions at the University Level,"The learning environment usually raises various types of anxiety based on the student's abilities to use technology and their abilities to overcome the negative feelings of an individual being watched all the time and criticized. Hence, learners still feel anxious while using computers and socializing in an e-learning environment. Learners who are faced with computer and AI tools are confused and frustrated. The uneasiness stems from anxiety or uneasiness, which is highly evident in daily interaction with computers and artificial intelligence tools or devices in e-learning contexts. The uneasiness stems from anxiety or uneasiness, which is highly evident in the daily interaction with computers and artificial intelligence tools or devices in e-learning contexts. To investigate this phenomenon empirically, a questionnaire was distributed among a group of undergraduate students who are studying different majors. This study aims to investigate the role of social anxiety and computer anxiety in an e-learning environment at the university level. Universities in the Gulf area are among those implementing e-learning systems. In spite of this, recent studies have shown that most students at Gulf universities are still resistant to using online systems; hence, it is necessary to determine the type of anxiety that creates such resistance and their relationship with other external variables such as motivation, satisfaction and self-efficacy. Students would be more likely to use e-learning tools and participate more effectively in their courses using the accessible electronic channels when the degree of anxiety is low. In this study, we have proposed a theoretical framework to investigate the role of social anxiety and computer anxiety in e-learning environments in the Gulf region. We examined how different variables such as satisfaction, motivation and self-efficacy can negatively or positively affect these two types of anxiety.",2022,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00503,Development of the generative artificial intelligence awareness scale for secondary school students in Türkiye,"The widespread adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in education and daily life necessitates a deeper understanding of students' awareness and attitudes. However, there is a lack of appropriate and psychometrically validated tools to assess these constructs reliably. This study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of a newly developed scale measuring secondary school students' awareness of generative artificial intelligence in the Turkish context. This methodological study employed a cross-sectional, descriptive, and correlational design. The research was conducted with 444 secondary school students aged 14-18. Data were collected using a Demographic Information Form and the Generative Artificial Intelligence Awareness Scale. The study followed a three-stage process in line with the STROBE checklist: (1) item development, (2) expert evaluation for content validity, and (3) construct validity and reliability testing. Construct validity was assessed using Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analyses. Reliability was examined through Cronbach's alpha, corrected item-total correlations, and split-half reliability analysis. EFA revealed a three-factor structure: Basic Knowledge of Generative Artificial Intelligence, Positive Attitudes Toward Generative Artificial Intelligence, and Concerns About the Impacts of Generative Artificial Intelligence, explaining 54.29% of the total variance. CFA supported the model, yielding acceptable fit indices (chi 2/df = 3.792, RMSEA = 0.056, GFI = 0.905, CFI = 0.927, TLI = 0.919), indicating good model fit. The Cronbach's alpha for the total scale was 0.946, with subscale coefficients ranging from 0.822 to 0.925. Corrected item-total correlations ranged from 0.512 to 0.733. Split-half reliability for the first factor showed strong consistency (Spearman-Brown = 0.891, Guttman = 0.887, correlation between halves = 0.804). The findings demonstrate that the Turkish version of the generative artificial intelligenceawareness scale is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing students' knowledge, attitudes, and concerns about generative AI. What is Known:center dot Generative artificial intelligence (GAI) technologies are increasingly used by adolescents in educational settings, yet their awareness, ethical understanding, and usage patterns remain underexplored.center dot Existing measurement tools for AI literacy often target higher education students and lack specificity in assessing secondary school students' awareness of generative AI.What is New:center dot This study developed and psychometrically validated the first comprehensive scale to assess secondary school students' awareness of generative AI, including knowledge, attitudes, and ethical concerns.center dot The Generative Artificial Intelligence Awareness Scale (GAIAS) provides educators and policymakers with a reliable tool to evaluate and support adolescents' digital and ethical preparedness in the age of generative AI.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01487,AI teacherbots: The lure driving migration from offline to online learning,"In the era of advancing artificial intelligence (AI) technology, AI teacherbots are gaining popularity as a prevalent learning channel in online education. This study aims to explore the factors that affect learners’ channel-switching intention from conventional classroom environments to online learning with AI teacherbots. Drawing on push-pull-mooring (PPM) theory, this study posits positive effects of learners’ attitudes toward AI and the anthropomorphism in AI teacherbots on learners’ switching intentions. The study further suggests that these impacts are mediated by perceived credibility and moderated by the psychological phenomenon known as fear of missing out (FoMO). These hypotheses are empirically validated via questionnaire data collected from individuals in China who have confirmed prior experience with AI teacherbots. This study not only contributes to the growing work on switching to AI-driven learning channels, but also extends the PPM framework by unpacking the transition from conventional to AI-enhanced learning environments. The findings provide valuable insights into the understanding of learners’ channel switching intention, as well as the application and development of educational robots.

REC_06536,From resistance to acceptance: the dynamics of educators' intentions to use chatbots and the role of educators' autocratic behaviour,"PurposeThis study investigates the educational shift towards AI, focusing on chatbot technology. It examines educators' willingness to adopt chatbots, emphasizing the moderating role of autocratic behaviour. The research is based on the Educators' Adoption of ChatGPT Model (EACM), a foundational model that combines UTAUT and SQB frameworks with novel elements for educational adoption.Design/methodology/approachThis research utilized a quantitative approach, analysing data from 389 valid responses from faculty members of Saudi Arabian universities. Through careful scrutiny and PLS-SEM, the study validated the model's robustness and gained a nuanced understanding of the dynamics influencing the educators' intentions to adopt chatbot technology.FindingsThe research identified six factors that positively impact educators' inclinations to utilize chatbots, with Chatbots Resistance (CR) negatively affecting intentions. Perceived Educators' Effort Expectancy, Autonomous Motivation, Learners' AI Competency, Educators' Competency, Innovative Behaviour and Students' Engagement were key positive influencers. Conversely, factors like Unfair Evaluation, Students' Overreliance and Bias increased the CR. Educators' Autocratic Behaviour (EAB) moderated these effects, notably softening CR's negative impact on adoption intentions, highlighting complex dynamics in educators' chatbot adoption.Originality/valueThis study integrates facilitators and barriers into a unified chatbot adoption model in education, highlighting EAB as a novel moderator. It extends the UTAUT and EACM frameworks, demonstrating how educators' perceptions and leadership styles impact their intentions to adopt educational technology.

This study examined associations between AIAT-related perceptions and mental-health indicators (depression, anxiety, and stress) among visually impaired higher education students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). A quantitative research approach was employed, using a self-administrated questionnaire targeting 390 visually impaired students in KSA universities. Partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) was employed as the main data analysis technique. The findings emphasised two important issues. First, performance expectancy (PE) of AIAT adoption, Effort expectancy (EE), and social influence (SI) are forceful psychological facilitators that can buffer against the feeling of depression and anxiety in visually impaired university students. Second, minimising the feeling of stress requires more than the existence of good infrastructure or social support; it necessitates systemic and ongoing interventions, comprising proactive university support, an accessible learning context, and personalised training programmes. These insights highlight the need for implementing inclusive support systems that combine technological, psychological, and university dimensions to promote the advantages of AIAT adoption for visually impaired students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.4,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01489,"Perceptions, adoption intentions, and impacts of generative AI among Chinese university students","The rapid proliferation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technologies is reshaping global higher education ecosystems, but the factors driving student adoption in culturally distinct contexts such as China remain understudied. By integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM), trust theory, and the theory of planned behavior (TPB), this research identifies key determinants of GenAI adoption among 5,380 university students across 28 Chinese provinces through structural equation modeling. The results demonstrate that perceived usefulness (beta = 0.442) and trust (beta = 0.217) are the primary predictors of adoption intentions, while cultural dimensions such as collectivism and institutional trust significantly moderate the impact of subjective norms and risk perceptions. Notably, price sensitivity exerts a nonlinear inhibitory effect on adoption behavior (beta = 0.227), compounded by substantial regional disparities-utility sensitivity in eastern China surpasses that in western China by 23%. The findings challenge established Western models by underscoring the pivotal mediating role of trust in the relationship between technological utility and adoption intentions while revealing a cultural phenomenon of risk decoupling, where ethical concerns exert weaker behavioral constraints in high-usage contexts.

REC_13765,Assessing ChatGPT Adoption in Higher Education: An Empirical Analysis,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the educational landscape and reshaped learning experiences. Its adoption in higher education is increasing due to the recent plethora of AI tools (AITs) and their associated benefits. Romanian universities face the challenge of integrating AITs in the learning process. Thus, the students' attitudes and behavioral intentions concerning the use of AITs are meaningful. Technology acceptance models have been widely used to investigate factors that affect the intention to use a technology. ChatGPT (Chat Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) is a popular AIT among students. Therefore, this study presents a conceptual model for successfully adopting ChatGPT in a Romanian Higher Education Institution (HEI). A case study was conducted at the Faculty of Cybernetics, Statistics, and Economic Informatics at the Bucharest University of Economic Studies to test this model. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to validate and inspect the model's network of determinants. The findings indicate that perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU) are key predictors of student satisfaction (S) and trust (T), which in turn promote loyalty (L) to the AIT.

Findings from both studies consistently indicate that thesis writing self-efficacy functions as a constraining force, suppressing the intention to use Generative AI. At the same time, time pressure reduces thesis writing self-efficacy. In contrast, Generative AI self-efficacy serves as a driving force, facilitating the intention to use Generative AI, and trust in Generative AI enhances Generative AI self-efficacy. Study 3 conducted interviews with 20 graduate students, providing a more nuanced understanding of the relationship between writing competence and usage intention while identifying two additional inhibitory factors. By integrating quantitative and qualitative evidence, this study highlights the dual role of self-efficacy in the context of technology adoption.

Promoting ChatGPT literacy and exploring related psychological variables from user perspectives are as important as developing technology, focusing on the supply side. Therefore, this study proposed a model and explored the links between ChatGPT literacy, perceived trust, perceived usefulness, self-efficacy, and user satisfaction by surveying 423 adults recruited from an online crowdsourcing website. Structural equation modeling in the analysis of moment structures (AMOS) was employed to assess the proposed research model and test the direct effects. The indirect effects were analyzed using a user-defined estimand function in AMOS. The results did not support the effect of ChatGPT literacy on self-efficacy. However, we observed that ChatGPT literacy positively affected perceived trust, and trust significantly increased self-efficacy. We also observed a significant mediating effect of perceived trust. Moreover, ChatGPT literacy positively affected perceived usefulness, and then perceived usefulness significantly increased self-efficacy. The mediating role of perceived usefulness was also validated. The results revealed a positive self-efficacy effect on user satisfaction. The findings of this study provide theoretical and practical implications for literacy and technology acceptance theorists as well as developers and educators.

REC_02189,AI-powered EFL pedagogy: Integrating generative AI into university teaching preparation through UTAUT and activity theory,"This study explores the integration of generative AI into English as a Foreign Language (EFL) teaching preparation within Indonesian higher education, addressing the growing need to understand how emerging technologies can enhance pedagogical practices in a rapidly evolving educational landscape. By employing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) and Activity Theory, the research provides a robust analytical framework to examine the factors influencing lecturers' adoption of generative AI. The study is particularly relevant as generative AI offers significant potential to improve teaching efficiency and content personalization, yet its adoption presents challenges in aligning outputs with educational standards and maintaining meaningful teacher-student interaction. Using a mixed-methods approach, the research combined quantitative data from structured questionnaires with qualitative insights from reflective compositions, where lecturers critically evaluated their experiences with generative AI. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed that performance expectancy and social influence significantly and positively influenced behavioral intention, while effort expectancy had no significant effect. Facilitating conditions, unexpectedly, negatively impacted behavioral intention, likely due to satisfaction with existing resources reducing the perceived necessity for new tools. A strong positive correlation between behavioral intention and actual use behavior demonstrated the critical role of intention in driving adoption. Thematic analysis provided further depth by emphasizing both the benefits and challenges of generative AI, accentuating the importance of balancing its use with human instruction to ensure quality teaching and interaction. The study stresses the need for the strategic integration of generative AI, offering practical and theoretical insights into its adoption and implications for advancing EFL teaching in higher education.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.39,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02193,The critical role of trust in adopting AI-powered educational technology for learning: An instrument for measuring student perceptions,"In recent decades, we have witnessed the democratization of AI-powered Educational Technology (AI-EdTech). However, despite the increased accessibility and evolving technological capabilities, its adoption is accompanied by significant challenges, predominantly rooted in social and psychological aspects. At the same time, limited research has been conducted on human factors, especially trust, influencing students' readiness and willingness to adopt AI-EdTech. This study aims to bridge this gap by addressing the multidimensional nature of trust and developing a new instrument for measuring students' perceptions of adopting AI-EdTech. With 665 student responses, we employ Exploratory and Confirmatory Factor Analysis to provide evidence of the instrument's internal validity and identify four key factors influencing students' trust and readiness to adopt AI-EdTech. We then utilize Structural Equations Modeling to explore the causal relationships among these factors, confirming that students' trust in AI-EdTech positively influences AI-EdTech's perceived usefulness both directly and indirectly through AI-readiness. Finally, we use our instrument to analyze 665 student responses, covering eight courses and Bachelor's and Master's degree programs. Our contribution is two-fold. First, by introducing the empirically validated instrument, we address the need for more consistent and reliable assessments of trust-related factors in student adoption of AI-EdTech. Second, our findings confirm that student demographics, specifically gender and educational background, significantly correlated with their trust perceptions, emphasizing the importance of addressing the specific needs of students with various demographics.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13405,Personalizing AI tools for second language speaking: the role of gender and autistic traits,"Introduction It is important to consider individual differences in research on educational technology. This study investigates the interplay between autistic traits, gender, and the perception of artificial intelligence (AI) tools designed for second language (L2) speaking practice, contributing to a deeper understanding of inclusive educational technology.Methods A sample of 111 university students completed the Broad Autism Phenotype Questionnaire (BAPQ) to measure autistic traits (AU) and their sub-traits Aloof (AF), Rigid (RD), and Pragmatic Language (PL). Perceptions of AI tools were assessed across five dimensions: Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PEOU), Attitude (AT), Behavioral Intention (BI), and Usage Behavior (UB). The study utilized correlation and regression analyses to examine relationships between these variables, while exploring gender-specific moderating effects.Results Key findings revealed no significant gender differences in autistic traits or overall perceptions of AI tools. Contrary to expectations, autistic traits were negatively correlated with perceptions of AI tools, suggesting that current AI designs may not adequately support individuals with pronounced autistic traits. Additionally, gender moderated some relationships, with males displaying stronger associations between autistic traits and both PEOU and UB.Discussion This research bridges critical gaps by linking neurodiversity and gender to technology acceptance, advancing the field's understanding of individual differences in AI-based language learning. It underscores the importance of designing personalized and adaptive educational tools that address diverse learner needs, promoting inclusivity and effectiveness in L2 practice.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13812,Acceptance of Artificial Intelligence (ChatGPT) Among Trainee Teachers in Higher Education,"The deployment of artificial intelligence has also reached the classroom, especially in higher education. Despite the reluctance among teachers, and the risks and threats present, the tool also has many potential advantages. This study analyzes the knowledge, acceptance, and perception of the use of ChatGPT among Secondary Teaching Master's degree students in two universities of Northen Spain, by means of a questionnaire based on the UTAUT2 model, translated into Spanish and Basque, and answered by 60 trainee teachers. The results show a good knowledge and perception of user-friendliness, but low motivation, intention to use, and effective use. The benefits perceived by prospective teachers include speed in obtaining information, assistance with repetitive tasks, and positive impacts on motivation; while the risks identified include plagiarism and an over-reliance on technology. The benefits for teachers included assistance with receiving ideas for class and preparation or translation of teaching materials and evaluation tools, while attributing less importance to marking or automating feedback. Given its widespread presence, it is concluded that there is a need to improve teacher training in the use of AI to foster more effective integration and a more positive perception of these technologies in education.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01541,Using chatbots to support student goal setting and social presence in fully online activities: Learner engagement and perceptions,"Although fully online learning is now the ‘new normal’ in many parts of the world, its implementation is often beset by challenges such as the lack of student self-regulation, and the sense of isolation. In this paper, we explored the use of chatbots to support student goal setting (Study 1) and social presence (Study 2) in online activities. In Study 1, participants in a fully online course were invited to complete a goal setting activity prior to attending class via a goal-setting chatbot. The chatbot engaged participants with five questions developed based on the SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and timely) goal setting framework. In Study 2, English-as-Foreign-Language participants in a fully online course were tasked to complete listening practices. The learning buddy chatbot was designed based on the social presence framework (interpersonal communication, open communication, cohesive communication) to guide students through listening exercises. In both Study 1 and 2, we evaluated participants’ behavioral engagement by measuring their conversation records with the chatbots, as well as participants’ perceived usefulness and ease of use of the chatbots. We also gathered in-depth interview data concerning the participants’ perceptions of interacting with the chatbots. Overall, our findings found positive learner experiences with both chatbots with regard to the chatbots’ perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. We also provided suggestions for instructors to apply chatbots in teaching and learning.

Data were collected via validated instruments and analyzed via structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in a cross-sectional study that included 676 students from six universities in northern Peru. The findings indicated that the relationship between academic self-efficacy and AI dependency was substantially mediated by academic stress (beta = 0.398, p < 0.001). Furthermore, this relationship is serially mediated by academic stress and performance expectations (beta = 0.325, p < 0.001). Academic self-efficacy also had a direct and significant effect on AI dependency (beta = 0.444, p < 0.001). Paths that utilized critical thinking as a mediator were not statistically significant, contrary to expectations. The model accounted for 58.9% of the variance in AI dependency. These results indicate that students' levels of AI dependency are significantly influenced by psychological factors, including academic stress and performance expectations. This research contributes to the comprehension of the psychological processes that underlie the adoption of AI in higher education. It also offers valuable insights for the development of interventions that foster balanced AI use while enhancing academic self-efficacy.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.9,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13814,Exploring the Educational Acceptance and Use of Artificial Intelligence Tools: Perceptions Among Portuguese University Students,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) technologies has created both opportunities and challenges in higher education. AI tools are increasingly regarded as potentially transformative, yet also contested, resources for enhancing teaching and learning. This study investigates the behavioral intentions and use behavior of Generative AI (GenAI) tools among Portuguese university students by applying the extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT2) model. Seven predictors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, facilitating conditions, social influence, hedonic motivation, habit, and price/value) were included to develop a model explaining the behavioral intention and use behavior of AI tools. Data were collected from 323 Portuguese university students and analyzed using partial least squares structural equation modeling. The results show that only hedonic motivation and habit significantly influence behavioral intention, with habit emerging as the strongest predictor. Behavioral intention, in turn, positively affects use behavior. Moreover, gender also moderates the relationship between habit and behavioral intention. These findings deepen our understanding of GenAI tools' acceptance in higher education and underscore the central roles of enjoyment and routine in adoption processes. They further provide insights to support institutional strategies, inform curriculum design, and support the ethical integration of GenAI technologies in academic contexts.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01542,"What makes ALEKS learning successful?: influences of prior knowledge, learning time, self-efficacy, and resource management on learning achievement","Personalized learning has received notable attention due to its effectiveness, and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS) serve as a representative example. A commercially available ITS, Assessment and Learning in Knowledge Spaces (ALEKS) has particularly gained popularity in K-12 and higher education. The purposes of this study are to explore students' learning experience and satisfaction with ALEKS and to examine the influential factors of learning achievement in ALEKS. The participants were 100 Korean undergraduates enrolled in blended learning courses using ALEKS. We measured the participants' perceived satisfaction with ALEKS, as well as their self-efficacy and resource management. Additionally, ALEKS log data were used to evaluate learning achievement. For data analysis, we investigated why students were satisfied with learning with ALEKS and the influence of learning time, prior knowledge, self-efficacy, and resource management (e.g., time and learning environment management and effort regulation) on ALEKS learning achievement using a multiple regression model. The participants were satisfied with ALEKS because of the personalized learning features, learning effectiveness, learning motivation, and flexibility. Prior knowledge and learning time were statistically significant to predict ALEKS learning achievement. Self-efficacy, resource management, and effort regulation accounted for about 76.0% of ALEKS learning achievement. Practical implications are that instructors should systematically assess students' entry-level skills and provide an appropriate timeframe for learning. To enhance self-efficacy, instructors should provide vicarious experience (e.g., opportunities to compare learning progress with others on the dashboard menu) or social persuasion (e.g., encouraging comments on learning progress). A short orientation should also be given to teach applicable resource management and effort regulation strategies for studying with ALEKS.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02198,A cross-country analysis of self-determination and continuance use intention of AI tools in business education: Does instructor support matter?,"This study builds on the recent interest in AI adoption research in academic settings by highlighting the need for culturally sensitive AI educational tools. The study achieved this by demonstrating how cultural differences shape students' motivation and AI use. This study adopts a cross-country comparative analytical approach to explore postgraduate students' motivation to continue using AI tools in the context of higher education. The study developed a theoretical model based on Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Expectation Disconfirmation Theory (EDT) to explore how perceived competence, perceived relatedness and perceived autonomy influence the continuance use intention of AI tools in two culturally unique higher education contexts-United Kingdom and Nigeria. The study also investigates how instructor support, AI anxiety and Trust in AI moderate the relationship between self-determination and AI continuance use intention of students. The data for this study was collected using Qualtrics online survey to generate responses from postgraduate students in the UK and Nigerian HEIs contexts. The questionnaire was designed using validated existing scales. Overall, 245 and 214 valid responses were received from Nigeria and UK postgraduate students respectively. The data was analysed using Structural Equation Modelling. The findings show that perceived relatedness and perceived autonomy are important predictors of AI tools continuance use intention in both countries. The findings reveal the role of cultural differences in AI use and the relative importance of relatedness and autonomy. The results also demonstrate that instructor support plays a fundamental role in AI use. The perceived impact of AI anxiety and trust in AI on competence, relatedness and autonomy vary between the different contexts. The findings emphasise the need for culturally adaptable AI systems capable of prioritizing either collaborative or individual characteristics based on the cultural setting. The findings provide useful insights for institutions and technology firms who are interested in developing globally acceptable AI tools for educational use.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13872,Generative AI in Healthcare: Insights from Health Professions Educators and Students,"The integration of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into health professions education (HPE) is rapidly transforming learning environments, raising questions about its impact on teaching and learning. This mixed methods study explores clinical educators' and undergraduate students' perceptions and attitudes about using GenAI tools in HPE at a tertiary hospital in Singapore. Using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) as theoretical frameworks, we designed and administered a survey and conducted interviews to assess participants' perceived usefulness, ease of use, and concerns related to GenAI adoption. Quantitative survey data were analyzed for frequencies and percentages, while qualitative responses underwent thematic analysis. Results showed that students demonstrated higher GenAI adoption rates (68.7%) compared to educators (38.5%), with GenAI perceived as valuable for efficiency, research, and personalized learning. However, concerns included over-reliance on GenAI, diminished critical thinking, and ethical implications. Educators emphasized the need for institutional guidelines and training to support responsible GenAI integration. Our findings suggest that while GenAI holds great potential for enhancing education, structured institutional policies and ethical oversight are crucial for its effective use.

REC_13878,Factors Influencing Students' Intention to Use E-Textbooks and Their Impact on Academic Achievement in Bilingual Environment: An Empirical Study Jordan,"E-textbooks are becoming increasingly important in the learning and teaching environments as the globe shifts to online learning. The key topic is what elements influence students' behavioral desire to use e-textbooks, and how the whole operation affects academic achievement when using e-textbooks. This research aims to investigate the various factors that influence the behavioral intention to use an e-textbook, which in turn influences academic achievement in a bilingual academic environment. The research model was empirically validated using survey data from 625 e-textbook users from bilingual academic institutes from Jordan. Structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis was employed to test the research hypotheses by using Amos 20. To validate the results, artificial intelligence (AI) was employed via five machine learning (ML) techniques: artificial neural network (ANN), linear regression, and sequential minimal optimization algorithm for support vector machine (SMO), bagging with REFTree model, and random forest. The empirical results offer several key findings. First, the behavioral intention of using an e-textbook positively influences academic achievement. Second, attitude toward e-textbooks, subjective norms toward e-textbooks, and perceived behavior control toward e-textbooks positively influence behavioral intention toward using e-textbooks. Attitude toward using e-textbooks and perceived behavioral control both are positively influenced by independent factors. This study contributes to the literature by theorizing and empirically testing the impacts of e-textbooks on the academic achievement of university students in a bilingual environment in Jordan.",2022,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02200,How do ChatGPT's benefit-risk-coping paradoxes impact higher education in Taiwan and Indonesia?,"The integration of ChatGPT into higher education in Taiwan and Indonesia presents both opportunities and challenges. This integration creates a paradox of benefits and risks that must be carefully managed. While previous studies have explored ChatGPT's applications, its complexities in educational contexts remain partially unaddressed. This study bridges that gap by integrating the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) with Protection Motivation Theory (PMT) to examine ChatGPT's role through a benefit-risk-coping mechanism. Data were collected from higher education users in Taiwan and Indonesia. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) revealed distinct patterns in the two regions. In Taiwan, perceived severity reduces the intention to use ChatGPT, while self-efficacy fosters adoption. In Indonesia, users emphasize response efficacy and performance expectancy as stronger predictors of usage intention. Task efficiency and performance expectancy enhance usage intention in both settings, with Indonesia showing a stronger link between intention and actual use. Fuzzy sets Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) further identifies diverse configurations for actual usage and disusage of ChatGPT. Task efficiency and performance expectancy emerge as key usage drivers in both contexts. Disusage in Taiwan primarily stems from task inefficiency, whereas multiple factors-including low self-efficacy-hinder adoption in Indonesia. These findings provide practical insights for higher education institutions, guiding strategies to optimize ChatGPT's benefits, minimize risks, and ensure its responsible use in educational settings across Taiwan and Indonesia.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01677,Exploring Perspectives: Integration of GenAI in Academia among Faculty and Students in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia,"The advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) technologies has created a surge to explore their impact on academia. This study investigates the perceptions of faculty and students in Saudi universities through a survey involving 162 faculty members and 663 students across 20+ universities. Data were collected to analyze attitudes, awareness and concerns surrounding the use of GenAI in educational contexts. The study aims to provide insights into the potential benefits, challenges, and ethical considerations associated with the integration of GenAI in teaching, research, and learning. Findings from this study contribute to a deeper understanding of the evolving relationship between GenAI technologies and education, informing future directions for research, policy, and practice in the field. We found that both groups are enthusiastic about the use of GenAI in education. However, there is a noticeable misalignment in their views, particularly concerning faculty encouragement, adoption and risks. Hence, we call for the following: 1- educational institutions should have clear policies for AI use that explain what is allowed and what is not. 2- they should provide tailored training and integrate the topic of GenAI into digital literacy courses to support responsible and effective usage. 3- they should encourage innovation in AI usage in education and award outstanding examples. 4- they are encouraged to reuse the national framework for using AI in education developed by SDAIA and the National e-Learning Center. 5- diverse assessment strategies such as oral examinations, project-based evaluations, and interactive discussions should be used to encourage originality and deeper understanding.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.35,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_02202,Adapting teaching and learning with existing generative AI by higher education Students: Comparative study of Zayed University and King Abdulaziz University,"This study examines the role of higher education students' perceptions in adapting Generative AI (GenAI) tools for teaching and learning, with a particular focus on the factors that influence student satisfaction and engagement. A comparative approach is adopted, exploring student experiences at Zayed University (ZU) in the UAE and King Abdulaziz University (KAU) in Saudi Arabia. The principal variables of interest, including Expected Benefits (EB), University Support (US), Ethical Awareness (EA), and Technology Self-Efficacy (TSE), are examined, with particular attention to their direct and mediated influences through Behavioral Intention (BI) on student satisfaction (SS). Data were collected through surveys and analyzed using SmartPLS-4. The findings reveal notable similarities and differences between the two universities. At both ZU and KAU, BI demonstrated the strongest direct influence on SS, confirming its central role. EB and TSE significantly impacted SS both directly and indirectly through BI in both contexts, although their effects were stronger at KAU. Conversely, US and EA showed no significant direct or mediated effects on SS at either institution. R2 values indicated substantial explanatory power of the model, and Q2 values confirmed strong predictive relevance. These results suggest that while the core drivers (BI, EB, TSE) are consistent across contexts, institutional and cultural factors shape their relative impact. The findings highlight the importance of integrating GenAI tools into teaching practices and emphasize the role of student motivation, confidence, and institutional support in fostering effective adoption and enhancing learning experiences. Institutions should prioritize enhancing students' perceived benefits and technological self-efficacy by providing practical training and demonstrating the value of GenAI tools. These factors significantly influence student satisfaction and engagement, particularly in culturally distinct settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13882,Higher Education Students' Perceptions of GenAI Tools for Learning,"Students' perceptions of tools with which they learn affect the outcomes of this learning. GenAI tools are new tools that have promise for students' learning, especially higher education students. Examining students' perceptions of GenAI tools as learning tools can help instructors better plan activities that utilize these tools in the higher education context. The present research considers four components of students' perceptions of GenAI tools: efficiency, interaction, affect, and intention. To triangulate data, it combines the quantitative and the qualitative methodologies, by using a questionnaire and by conducting interviews. A total of 153 higher education students responded to the questionnaire, while 10 higher education students participated in the interview. The research results indicated that the means of affect, interaction, and efficiency were significantly medium, while the mean of intention was significantly high. The research findings showed that in efficiency, affect, and intention, male students had significantly higher perceptions of AI tools than female students, but in the interaction component, the two genders did not differ significantly. Moreover, the degree affected only the perception of interaction of higher education students, where the mean value of interaction was significantly different between B.A. and Ph.D. students in favor of Ph.D. students. Moreover, medium-technology-knowledge and high-technology-knowledge students differed significantly in their perceptions of working with AI tools in the interaction component only, where this difference was in favor of the high-technology-knowledge students. Furthermore, AI knowledge significantly affected efficiency, interaction, and affect of higher education students, where they were higher in favor of high-AI-knowledge students over low-AI-knowledge students, as well as in favor of medium-AI-knowledge students over low-AI-knowledge students.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01679,Integrating motivated goal achievement in maritime simulator training,"The application of cloud-based simulators has increasing momentum in maritime education and training as a virtual platform for supplementing professional training with task-specific simulation-based learning. Congruent with traditional simulator technology and training methods, this new condition allows for asynchronous and unlimited simulator access where participation in training sessions is at the discretion of the trainee. Furthermore, this provides a learning environment that can have adaptive features to the trainee characteristics with selectable complexity levels, automated feedback, and automated performance assessment. With the advent of this emerging training technology, the organization of how training is deployed, the new roles and expectations for trainees and instructors, and the application of new data-driven analytics are not yet well understood. This paper employs a quasi-experimental study to investigate trainee motivation, personality traits, and task performance using a novel training design. The study was administered remotely to a sample (N = 18) of first-year maritime students who first completed a knowledge acquisition phase before conducting a skill acquisition phase with repeated simulator training of a procedural task, and finally a performance assessment of the simulator scenario. Data was collected from (1) a multiple-choice knowledge test, (2) a short-scaled Big Five Inventory, (3) the Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire, and (4) programmed simulator metrics. Results indicate that Extraversion correlates with motivation and self-efficacy predicts training performance. No significant relationship between prior knowledge and the training performance was found.

REC_02203,Assessing the importance of variables from a revised technology acceptance model for the use of ChatGPT by university students,"Students and researchers are increasingly relying on ChatGPT as a tool to search for information, generate content, make translations and offer research support. This study employs nine variables derived from the Technology Acceptance Model to evaluate whether the variables can predict ChatGPT use among university students in the Philippines. To achieve this, a survey was carried out. Data was collected from 340 students across various faculties of a university. The data were analyzed with structural equation modeling (SEM). The model predicts that the nine variables that reflect students' perceptions towards ChatGPT, are indirectly or directly related to the students' use of ChatGPT. The SEM analysis showed that students' performance expectancy, effort expectancy and social influence were related to their attitude towards ChatGPT. The students' attitude together with their perception of the reliability and credibility of ChatGPT were related to intention to use ChatGPT. Intention to use ChatGPT together with trust in this tool were directly related to the actual use of ChatGPT. Additionally, artificial neural network (ANN) analysis was employed for further model optimization. The ANN analysis showed that from the nine predictor variables: 'trust', 'intention to use', 'accuracy' and 'attitude' were most strongly related to students' use of ChatGPT.

REC_00730,Determinants of higher education teachers' intention to use technology-based exams,"The replacement of existing technology or the introduction of novel technology into the day-to-day routines of higher education institutions is not a trivial task. Currently, many higher education institutions are faced with the challenge of replacing existing procedures for administering written exams with e-exams. To guide this process, this paper proposes the novel technology-based exams acceptance model (TEAM) and empirically evaluates its model structure and usefulness from the perspective of higher education teachers. The model can be used to guide the transition from paper-based exams to e-exams and the implementation of innovative (e.g., adaptive) e-exam formats. The model includes perceived usefulness, computer self-efficacy, computer anxiety, prior experience, facilitating conditions, and subjective norm as predictors of the behavioral intention to use e-exams. To test the model empirically, the responses of 992 teachers at 63 German universities to a standardized online questionnaire were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The model fit was acceptable. With 77% (conventional e-exams) and 82% (adaptive e-exams), a large proportion of the variance of the intention to use these types of exams was explained. With TEAM, a highly predictive model for explaining the behavioral intention to use e-exams is now available.

Therefore, this research intended to identify the determinants of BDA in the education sector. A theoretical model was developed based on the integration of the Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) and Diffusion of Innovation (DOI) theories. The data was collected from 190 decision-makers in university campuses in Pakistan. A two-step structural equation modeling-artificial neural network (SEM-ANN) approach was employed to unveil the determinants of BDA and predict their levels of importance. The results obtained from the SEM showed that compatibility, IT infrastructure, management support, financial resources, security and privacy, and government guidelines were important determinants of BDA. Meanwhile, the ANN algorithm highlighted security and privacy as the most important predictors of BDA. The findings can assist higher education commissions, big data facilitators, and university managements in providing safe and successful BDA in university campuses.",2023,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.35,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13894,Mitigating Learning Burnout Caused by Generative Artificial Intelligence Misuse in Higher Education: A Case Study in Programming Language Teaching,"The advent of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) has significantly transformed the educational landscape. While GenAI offers benefits such as convenient access to learning resources, it also introduces potential risks. This study explores the phenomenon of learning burnout among university students resulting from the misuse of GenAI in this context. A questionnaire was designed to assess five key dimensions: information overload and cognitive load, overdependence on technology, limitations of personalized learning, shifts in the role of educators, and declining motivation. Data were collected from 143 students across various majors at Shandong Institute of Petroleum and Chemical Technology in China. In response to the issues identified in the survey, the study proposes several teaching strategies, including cheating detection, peer learning and evaluation, and anonymous feedback mechanisms, which were tested through experimental teaching interventions. The results showed positive outcomes, with students who participated in these strategies demonstrating improved academic performance. Additionally, two rounds of surveys indicated that students' acceptance of additional learning tasks increased over time. This research enhances our understanding of the complex relationship between GenAI and learning burnout, offering valuable insights for educators, policymakers, and researchers on how to effectively integrate GenAI into education while mitigating its negative impacts and fostering healthier learning environments.

REC_00742,"Modeling the structural relationships among Chinese secondary school students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, AI literacy, and approaches to learning AI","K-12 artificial intelligence (AI) education requires cultivating students' computational thinking in the school curriculum so as to transfer their computational thinking to diverse problems and authentic contexts. However, students may be limited by traditional computational thinking development activities because they may have a lower degree of computational thinking efficacy for persistent learning of AI when encountering difficulties (computational thinking efficacy in learning AI). Accordingly, this study aimed to explore the relationships among Chinese secondary school students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, their AI literacy, and approaches to learning AI. Structural equation modeling was adopted to examine the mediation effect. Data were gathered from 509 Chinese secondary school students, and the confirmatory factor analyses showed that the measures had high reliability and validity. The results revealed that AI literacy was positively related to students' computational thinking efficacy in learning AI, which was mediated by more sophisticated approaches to learning AI, contributing to the current understanding of learning AI. It is crucial to focus on students' AI literacy and deep approaches (e.g., engaging in authentic AI contexts with systematic learning activities for in-depth understanding of AI knowledge) rather than surface approaches (e.g., memorizing AI knowledge) to develop their high-level computational thinking efficacy in learning AI.

REC_06742,The role of AI characteristics and their influence on higher education students’ continuance intention to use GenAI tools,"Purpose – The purpose of this study is to identify the factors that contribute to the continued intention and actual use of GenAI tools among Indian university students. Generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools significantly transform and disrupt the education sector, offering substantial opportunities for educators and learners. Previous research has predominantly concentrated on adopting ChatGPT within the education sector; however, the effects of other generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools in education remain insufficiently explored. Furthermore, it examines how AI characteristics such as perceived anthropomorphism, perceived intelligence and perceived technology novelty (TN) influence perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use, which are the predictors of continuance intention. Design/methodology/approach – This study develops a theoretical model incorporating AI features as antecedents to the Technology Continuance Theory (TCT). This study uses a cross-sectional survey to collect responses from Indian higher education students. The authors use the PLS-SEM model with SmartPLS 4.0 for analysis. Findings – This study tested the applicability of TCT in GenAI usage in education settings. This research empirically proved that perceived intelligence and TN are the antecedents to perceived use and ease of use. From the TCT model, satisfaction and attitude positively influenced continuance intention to use GenAI tools, and continuance intention positively influenced the actual use of GenAI in education. Originality/value – This study empirically validated the use of various GenAI tools in the teaching and learning process, contributing to the existing research. This study is one of the earliest to examine the human–AI interaction in an educational setting. This study empirically tested TCT from the perspective of higher education students’ actual use of GenAI tools. The findings of this study offer many practical insights for stakeholders, such as EdTech companies, AI companies, GenAI developers, educators and academic institutions, to implement GenAI tools successfully. © 2025 Emerald Publishing Limited",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_00743,Investigating student acceptance of an academic advising chatbot in higher education institutions,"The study explores factors affecting university students' behavioural intentions in adopting an academic advising chatbot. The study focuses on functional, socio-emotional, and relational factors affecting students' acceptance of an AI-driven academic advising chatbot. The research is based on a conceptual model derived from several constructs of traditional technology acceptance models, TAM, UTAUT, the latest AI-driven self-service technologies models, the Service Robot Acceptance (sRAM) model, and the intrinsic motivation Self Determination Theory (SDT) model. The proposed conceptual model has been tailored to an educational context. A questionnaire Survey of Non-purposive sampling technique was applied to collect data points from 207 university students from two major universities in the UAE. Subsequently, PLS-SEM causal modelling was applied for hypothesis testing. The results revealed that the functional elements, perceived ease of use and social influence significantly affect behavioural intention for chatbots' acceptance. However, perceived usefulness, autonomy, and trust did not show significant evidence of influence on the acceptance of an advising chatbot. The study reviews chatbot literature and presents recommendations for educational institutions to implement AI-driven chatbots effectively for academic advising. It is one of the first studies that assesses and examines factors that impact the willingness of higher education students to accept AI-driven academic advising chatbots.

REC_01736,Perceptions of machine learning among therapists Practicing applied behavior analysis: A national survey,"Collecting data and logging behaviors of clients who have autism spectrum disorder (ASD) during applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapy sessions can be challenging in real time, especially when the behaviors require a rapid response, like self-injury or aggression. Little information is available about the automation of data collection in ABA therapy, such as through machine learning (ML). Our survey of ABA therapists nationally revealed mixed levels of familiarity with ML and generally neutral responses to statements endorsing the benefits of ML. Higher certification levels and more years of experience with ABA were associated with decreased confidence in ML’s ability to accurately identify behaviors during ABA sessions whereas previous familiarity with ML was associated with confidence in ML, comfort with using ML, and trust that ML technology can keep client data secure. Understanding the perceptions of ABA therapists can guide future endeavors to incorporate ML for automated behavior logging into ABA practice.Applied behavior analysis (ABA) therapists perceive some value in utilizing machine learning (ML) in data collection during ABA sessions, but the majority of therapists are not familiar with the concept of ML.In our survey, ABA therapists with greater familiarity with ML were more likely to be comfortable using ML in their practice.Surveyed ABA therapists with higher certification levels and more experience with ABA were less likely to be confident in ML’s ability to identify behaviors accurately.Awareness of ABA therapists’ perspectives about ML, especially regarding privacy and security, and partnership with computer scientists can further the development of ML technology to augment data collection during ABA therapy.Educating ABA therapists about the potential of ML, especially the potential to reduce the burden of behavior logging while simultaneously intervening for aggressive and self-injurious behaviors, will be necessary for successful implementation of ML in ABA therapy settings.

REC_02218,Artificial intelligence as a pedagogical communicator: mixed-methods insights from Raffles International College Bangkok,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly employed as a pedagogical assistant in higher education, but its role as a communicator in diverse classrooms is not fully understood. This mixed-methods study investigates AI as a pedagogical communicator at a private international college in Bangkok. The study extends the Technology Acceptance Model by integrating social presence and trust constructs to examine factors influencing student engagement and satisfaction with AI-mediated instruction. In an explanatory sequential design, a survey of 300 students was analyzed using structural equation modeling, followed by 10 in-depth interviews. Results indicated that student satisfaction is driven by two mediated pathways: perceived social presence in AI communication builds trust, which enhances satisfaction, and perceived usefulness of AI feedback promotes engagement, which likewise increases satisfaction. Ease of interacting with the AI increased perceived presence and usefulness and thus indirectly boosted satisfaction; however, it also raised expectations that sometimes dampened satisfaction. Interview themes clarified these patterns. Students valued the AI's clear explanations, responsiveness, and roundthe-clock support, which improved efficiency and engagement, but also noted its lack of human warmth and increased pressure from constant availability. These findings suggest design principles for AI communicators, such as using friendly, context-aware language and clear rationales to build trust, and providing stepwise, practical feedback to sustain engagement. In sum, culturally responsive AI tutors that balance human-like connection with instructional efficiency can enhance student engagement and satisfaction in multicultural educational settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.2,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13917,How Perceived Motivations Influence User Stickiness and Sustainable Engagement with AI-Powered Chatbots-Unveiling the Pivotal Function of User Attitude,"Artificial intelligence (AI) is reshaping customer service, with AI-powered chatbots serving as a critical component in delivering continuous support across sales, marketing, and service domains, thereby enhancing operational efficiency. However, consumer engagement remains suboptimal, as many users favor human interaction due to concerns regarding chatbots' ability to address complex issues and their perceived lack of empathy, which subsequently reduces satisfaction and sustainable usage. This study examines the determinants of user attitude and identifies factors influencing sustainable chatbot use. Utilizing survey data from 735 Chinese university students who have engaged with AI-powered chatbots, the analysis reveals that four key motivational categories: utilitarian (information acquisition), hedonic (enjoyment and time passing), technology (media appeal), and social (social presence and interaction) significantly influence user attitude toward chatbot services. Conversely, privacy invasion exerts a negative impact on user attitude, suggesting that while chatbots provide certain benefits, privacy issues can significantly undermine user satisfaction. Moreover, the findings suggest that user attitude serves as a pivotal determinant in fostering both user stickiness and sustainable usage of chatbot services. This study advances prior U&G-, TAM-, and ECM-based research by applying these frameworks to AI-powered chatbots in business communication, refining the U&G model with four specific motivations, integrating perceived privacy invasion to bridge gratification theory with risk perception, and directly linking user motivations to business outcomes such as attitude and stickiness. This study underscores that optimizing chatbot functionalities to enhance user gratification while mitigating privacy risks can substantially improve user satisfaction and stickiness, offering valuable implications for businesses aiming to enhance customer loyalty through AI-powered services.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_06866,IntelliA: an intelligent educational assignment practicing platform driven by generative AI,"PurposeEducational assignments are pivotal for student learning, yet educators face the dual burden of creating meaningful questions and providing timely, individualized feedback. This study introduces IntelliA, a generative AI-powered platform designed to address these challenges by holistically automating the entire assignment lifecycle, from pedagogically aware question generation to concept-centric evaluation, thereby alleviating instructor workload and enhancing student learning outcomes.Design/methodology/approachIntelliA's core innovation is a synergistic architecture that operationalizes pedagogical principles directly into the AI-driven assignment workflow. For question generation, its pedagogical primitive-driven system allows educators to design assessments at a conceptual level - by selecting instructional goals - rather than manually crafting prompts. For evaluation, a novel three-stage, rubric-driven methodology is designed to produce pedagogically valuable feedback, grounding its supportive guidance in objective, evidence-based scoring. These subsystems are unified by a unified quality augmentation module, creating a self-reinforcing loop that continuously refines the system's pedagogical alignment. This architecture's ability to enhance both educational quality and operational efficiency was rigorously validated through a semester-long university deployment, assessed via a multi-faceted framework of instructor interviews, student surveys and cross-model benchmarking.FindingsThe results demonstrate that IntelliA significantly reduces assignment creation time for instructors while maintaining high pedagogical quality in generated questions. Student surveys revealed high satisfaction with the grading accuracy and the personalized, actionable feedback, which they reported as instrumental to their learning. The findings confirm that an architecturally sophisticated AI system can successfully move beyond simple automation to enhance both operational efficiency and educational quality.Research limitations/implicationsOur study's validation was conducted within a single university STEM course, which limits the generalizability of our findings. Future research should expand the library of pedagogical primitives to diverse domains (e.g. humanities and K-12) and validate their effectiveness in these new contexts. Additionally, a more rigorous, controlled experiment is needed to quantitatively measure efficiency gains in terms of time-on-task and cognitive load. This work signals a shift in AI-in-education research, moving from single-task automation toward designing synergistic, architecturally aware systems.Practical implicationsIntelliA offers a practical, scalable solution for educators to significantly reduce the workload associated with assignment creation and feedback personalization. By automating routine tasks, the platform empowers instructors to shift their focus from content generation to higher-value pedagogical activities, such as refining learning objectives and providing nuanced student support. This model demonstrates how AI can be integrated into educational workflows as a collaborative partner, enhancing both operational efficiency and the quality of pedagogical practice.Social implicationsThe widespread adoption of synergistic AI systems like IntelliA could democratize access to high-quality, personalized learning support, potentially narrowing educational equity gaps. However, it also raises critical social questions about the future of the teaching profession and the risk of over-reliance on automation. The key social implication is the need for a public discourse on responsible AI integration in education, ensuring that technology serves to amplify educator agency and enhance human-centric learning, rather than deskilling teachers or creating uniform, passive learning pathways.Originality/valueThis study presents a significant leap forward by proposing a novel, synergistic system architecture for AI in education. Unlike prior systems that address isolated tasks, IntelliA offers a holistically integrated and self-improving ecosystem. By demonstrating how to embed pedagogical principles directly into an AI's core logic, IntelliA provides a scalable and flexible blueprint for a new generation of educational tools. This approach moves beyond simple automation, fostering a new dynamic where AI functions not as a mere instrument but as a genuine partner in the pedagogical process.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_01776,"Algorithmically-driven writing and academic integrity: exploring educators' practices, perceptions, and policies in AI era","BackgroundDespite global interest in the interface of Algorithmically-driven writing tools (ADWTs) and academic integrity, empirical data considering educators' perspectives on the challenges, benefits, and policies of ADWTs use remain scarce.AimThis study responds to calls for empirical investigation concerning the affordances and encumbrances of ADWTs, and their implications for academic integrity.MethodsUsing a cross-sectional survey research design, we recruited through snowball sampling 100 graduate students and faculty members representing ten disciplines. Participants completed an online survey on perceptions, practices, and policies in the utilization of ADWTs in education. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) helped us understand the factors influencing the acceptance and use of ADWTs.ResultsThe study found that teacher respondents highly value the diverse ways ADWTs can support their educational goals (perceived usefulness). However, they must overcome their barrier threshold such as limited access to these tools (perception of external control), a perceived lack of knowledge on their use (computer self-efficacy), and concerns about ADWTs' impact on academic integrity, creativity, and more (output quality).ConclusionAI technologies are making headway in more educational institutions because of their proven and potential benefits for teaching, learning, assessment, and research. However, AI in education, particularly ADWTs, demands critical awareness of ethical protocols and entails collaboration and empowerment of all stakeholders by introducing innovations that showcase human intelligence over AI or partnership with AI.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_06868,Exploring higher education students' continuance usage intention of ChatGPT: amalgamation of the information system success model and the stimulus-organism-response paradigm,"PurposeThe advent of artificial intelligence technologies, exemplified by platforms such as ChatGPT, has created a profound global impact, with a particular resonance in education. This research aims to integrate the information systems success (ISS) model with the stimulus-organism-response (SOR) paradigm to explore how information quality and service quality individually, jointly, congruently, and incongruently affect higher education students' trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and continuance usage intention.Design/methodology/approachWe employed a sophisticated methodology - polynomial regression with response surface analysis - and conducted our study with a sample of 468 higher education students selected in Vietnam using a three-phase stratified random sampling approach to evaluate the hypotheses developed.FindingsThe findings indicate that both information and service quality influence higher education students' trust directly and positively in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and continuance usage intention. Moreover, a balance between information quality and service quality can increase students' level of trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and intention to continue using it. Nevertheless, a significant incongruity between information quality and service quality will likely reduce trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and the intention to continue using the service.Originality/valueThis research is one of the first to offer a shred of empirical evidence about how information quality and service quality interact congruently and incongruently with each other to trigger higher education students' trust in ChatGPT, satisfaction, and continuance usage intention of ChatGPT.

REC_01777,"Knowledge, attitudes, and perceived Ethics regarding the use of ChatGPT among generation Z university students","Artificial intelligence (AI) has been integrated into higher education (HE), offering numerous benefits and transforming teaching and learning. Since its launch, ChatGPT has become the most popular learning model among Generation Z college students in HE. This study aimed to assess the knowledge, concerns, attitudes, and ethics of using ChatGPT among Generation Z college students in HE in Peru. An online survey was administered to 201 HE students with prior experience using the ChatGPT for academic activities. Two of the six proposed hypotheses were confirmed: Perceived Ethics (B = 0.856) and Student Concerns (B = 0.802). The findings suggest that HE students' knowledge and positive attitudes toward ChatGPT do not guarantee its effective adoption and use. It is important to investigate how attitudes of optimism, skepticism, or apathy toward AI develop and how these attitudes influence the intention to use technologies such as the ChatGPT in HE settings. The dependence on ChatGPT raises ethical concerns that must be addressed with responsible use programs in HE. No sex or age differences were found in the relationship between the use of ChatGPTs and perceived ethics among HE students. However, further studies with diverse HE samples are needed to determine this relationship. To promote the ethical use of the ChatGPT in HE, institutions must develop comprehensive training programs, guidelines, and policies that address issues such as academic integrity, privacy, and misinformation. These initiatives should aim to educate students and university teachers on the responsible use of ChatGPT and other AI-based tools, fostering a culture of ethical adoption of AI to leverage its benefits and mitigate its potential risks, such as a lack of academic integrity.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.47,,E3,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_13546,Using Chatbots as AI Conversational Partners in Language Learning,"Recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning have paved the way for the increasing adoption of chatbots in language learning. Research published to date has mostly focused on chatbot accuracy and chatbot-human communication from students' or in-service teachers' perspectives. This study aims to examine the knowledge, level of satisfaction and perceptions concerning the integration of conversational AI in language learning among future educators. In this mixed method research based on convenience sampling, 176 undergraduates from two educational settings, Spain (n = 115) and Poland (n = 61), interacted autonomously with three conversational agents (Replika, Kuki, Wysa) over a four-week period. A learning module about Artificial Intelligence and language learning was specifically designed for this research, including an ad hoc model named the Chatbot-Human Interaction Satisfaction Model (CHISM), which was used by teacher candidates to evaluate different linguistic and technological features of the three conversational agents. Quantitative and qualitative data were gathered through a pre-post-survey based on the CHISM and the TAM2 (technology acceptance) models and a template analysis (TA), and analyzed through IBM SPSS 22 and QDA Miner software. The analysis yielded positive results regarding perceptions concerning the integration of conversational agents in language learning, particularly in relation to perceived ease of use (PeU) and attitudes (AT), but the scores for behavioral intention (BI) were more moderate. The findings also unveiled some gender-related differences regarding participants' satisfaction with chatbot design and topics of interaction.",2022,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11339,Evaluating teachers’ perspectives on education-based assessments strategies with artificial intelligence,"This paper explores the possible effects of artificial intelligence (AI) on educational assessments with a focus on implementation challenges, assessment accuracy and institutional preparedness. Online questionnaires that included quantitative and qualitative methods were used to collect data from 68 postgraduate students and teachers at a Malaysian university utilising a sequential case study methodology. We used a self-designed tool comprising a validated questionnaire with Cronbach's alpha (0.76). The results draw attention to ethical questions, assessment accuracy problems, and a notable information gap regarding the use of artificial intelligence in education. Teachers had neutral to somewhat positive opinions on how artificial intelligence affects assignment accuracy though they voiced worries about its limitations. Although the integration of artificial intelligence shows potential, teachers underlined the necessity of further training and more solid institutional support. Though issues including ethical considerations and instructor preparedness still exist, artificial intelligence has the potential to improve assessment accuracy and efficiency. Good integration calls for a mixed strategy combining human supervision with AI's advantages. This paper emphasizes the need for institutional policies and professional growth to help artificial intelligence adoption in the sector. Maximizing the advantages of artificial intelligence and reducing its negative effects depend on addressing the worries of teachers. © 2025 Conscientia Beam.

REC_14142,Understanding Trust and Willingness to Use GenAI Tools in Higher Education: A SEM-ANN Approach Based on the S-O-R Framework,"Student trust plays a pivotal role in shaping the future integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education. This study investigates how AI Facilitating Conditions (FCs), Performance Expectancy (PE), and task type influence students' System-like Trust (AST) and Human-like Trust (AHT) in AI and further examines the mediating role of human-like trust in fostering the willingness to continue AI-assisted learning. Drawing on valid data collected from 466 Chinese university students, we employed partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) in combination with artificial neural networks (ANN) to test the hypothesized relationships, mediating mechanisms and the relative importance of influencing factors. The findings indicate that AI facilitating conditions significantly enhance both system-like trust and usage intention; performance expectancy exerts a positive effect on both forms of trust, with particularly strong effects observed in subjective tasks. Moreover, system-like trust positively promotes human-like trust, and together, these dimensions jointly strengthen students' intention to engage in AI-assisted learning. Results from the ANN analysis further highlight that performance expectancy, system-like trust, and facilitating conditions are the primary determinants of system-like trust, human-like trust, and usage intention, respectively. This study extends the application of interpersonal trust theory to the AI domain and offers theoretical insights for fostering more positive and effective patterns of AI adoption in higher education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07880,Pre‐service teachers' inclination to integrate AI into STEM education: Analysis of influencing factors,"In the ever‐evolving AI‐driven education, integrating AI technologies into teaching practices has become increasingly imperative for aspiring STEM educators. Yet, there remains a dearth of studies exploring pre‐service STEM teachers' readiness to incorporate AI into their teaching practices. This study examined the factors influencing teachers' willingness to integrate AI (WIAI), especially from the perspective of pre‐service STEM teachers' attitudes towards the application of AI in teaching. In the study, a comprehensive survey was conducted among 239 pre‐service STEM teachers, examining the influences and interconnectedness of Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK), Perceived Usefulness (PU), Perceived Ease of Use (PE), and Self‐Efficacy (SE) on WIAI. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) was employed for data analysis. The findings illuminated direct influences of TPACK, PU, PE, and SE on WIAI. TPACK was found to directly affect PE, PU, and SE, while PE and PU also directly influenced SE. Further analysis revealed significant mediating roles of PE, PU, and SE in the relationship between TPACK and WIAI, highlighting the presence of a chain mediation effect. In light of these insights, the study offers several recommendations on promoting pre‐service STEM teachers' willingness to integrate AI into their teaching practices. Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic? The potential of AI technologies to enrich learning experiences and improve outcomes in STEM education has been recognized. Pre‐service teachers' willingness to integrate AI into teaching practice is crucial for shaping the future learning environment. The TAM and TPACK frameworks are used to analyse teacher factors in technology‐supported learning environments. Few studies have been conducted for examining factors of pre‐service teachers' willingness to integrate AI into teaching practices in the context of STEM education. What this paper adds? A survey was designed and developed for exploring pre‐service STEM teachers' WIAI and its relationships with factors including TPACK, PE, PU, and SE. TPACK, SE, PU, and PE have direct impact on pre‐service STEM teachers' WIAI. SE, PU, and PE have been identified as mediating variables in the relationship between TPACK and WIAI. Two sequential mediation effects, TPACK → PE → SE → WIAI and TPACK → PU → SE → WIAI, among pre‐service STEM teachers were further identified. Implications of this study for practice and/or policy Pre‐service STEM teachers are encouraged to explore and utilize AI technology to enhance their confidence and self‐efficacy in integrating AI into teaching practices. Showcasing successful cases and practical experiences is essential for fostering awareness of AI integration in STEM education. It is recommended to introduce AI education courses in teacher training programs. Offering internship and practicum opportunities related to AI technologies can enhance their practical skills in integrating AI into education.

REC_08746,Determinants of artificial intelligence acceptance among undergraduates,"Despite the potential benefits of artificial intelligence (AI) brings to education, its extensive use does not automatically guarantee effective integration or consistent improvements in learning. Hence, this research aims to identify the determinants of AI acceptance among undergraduates and examine the relationship between these determinants and AI acceptance. Five determinants of AI acceptance were identified based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) and empirical evidence: perceived effectiveness of AI, user satisfaction, user attitude toward AI technology, attitude toward using AI, and user self-efficacy. This quantitative study focused on 791 undergraduates from a management school in Malaysia. A questionnaire was distributed to 310 undergraduates using a stratified sampling method, and 259 responses were collected. Descriptive analysis results indicated that undergraduates perceive attitudes toward AI technology and using AI as very important determinants of AI acceptance. Pearson correlation analysis also revealed that four determinants (perceived effectiveness of AI, satisfaction in using AI, attitude towards AI technology, attitude towards using AI) significantly correlated with AI acceptance. This finding suggests that, within the context of AI acceptance among management school undergraduates, attitude-related determinants are the primary drivers. The findings from this research could be used by the management school as a reference to enhance undergraduates’ AI acceptance levels and identify areas for inclusive education system improvement. © 2025, Institute of Advanced Engineering and Science.

REC_14887,Exploring the integration of artificial intelligence in education: An empirical study utilizing a hybrid SEMML,"Artificial intelligence is user-friendly and incorporates a useful number of characteristics that are common across the various services that are provided. By enhancing inventive engagement, artificial intelligence (AI) applications enable a more participatory setting in government agencies. The objective of this research is to find out how the UAE consumers feel about using AI in educational settings. Included in the framework are the characteristics of acceptance, which are: perceived compatibility, trialability, relative advantage, ease of doing business, and technology export. 466 questionnaires from various universities have been gathered. The research model was examined using machine learning algorithms (ML) and partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLSSEM), which centered on the student's questionnaire responses. The IPMA is also used in this research to evaluate performance and importance of the variables. The theoretical framework of the research links the qualities of the individual variables and those of the technology which makes it new. The findings indicate that the diffusion theory factors outperform the other two factors of ease of doing business and technology export. It ought to be mentioned that when it pertains to the estimated value of the dependent factor, the J48 classifier largely outperformed other classifiers. This study’s findings can guide educational institutions in the UAE to recognize the importance of each acceptance factor in the successful integration of AI technologies. Institutions can use these insights to tailor their strategies, enhancing AI adoption among students and faculty alike. Specifically, the results suggest prioritizing factors from diffusion theory in educational AI implementations, ensuring these technologies are perceived as advantageous and compatible with existing practices. Furthermore, the superiority of the J48 classifier suggests that similar analytical techniques could be employed by educational institutions to continually assess and improve their AI initiatives. The dominance of diffusion theory factors invites further exploration into how these elements specifically influence AI acceptance in other sectors or regions. Additionally, the comparative underperformance of ease of doing business and technology export as factors suggests a need for deeper investigation into how these dimensions can be better leveraged in the context of AI in education. Future research could also explore longitudinal studies to assess the sustainability of AI acceptance over time and experiment with integrating new machine learning algorithms to compare their predictive power against the J48 classifier in different educational settings. © 2025 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14144,Exploring Factors Influencing ChatGPT-Assisted Learning Satisfaction from an Information Systems Success Model Perspective: The Case of Art and Design Students,"As education undergoes digital transformation, ChatGPT-4 has emerged as one of the most visible tools of generative artificial intelligence. While widely discussed, its impact on student satisfaction and learning outcomes in higher education remains underexplored. This study investigates the factors that shape art and design students' satisfaction when using ChatGPT to support coursework. Unlike previous research focusing on ChatGPT adoption behavior, this study extends the Information Systems Success Model (ISSM) to the context of art and design education. Drawing on 435 valid survey responses, we employed a mixed-methods approach. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was first applied to examine how system quality, compatibility, personal innovativeness, and perceived usefulness influence satisfaction directly and through mediating mechanisms. To complement this, fuzzy-set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) was used to identify multiple combinations of conditions that lead to high satisfaction. The findings show that compatibility, perceived usefulness, and personal innovativeness significantly enhance satisfaction, with path coefficients of 0.378, 0.342, and 0.155, respectively. Importance-Performance Map Analysis (IPMA) further highlights personal innovativeness and system quality as critical drivers. By providing both theoretical and practical insights, this study contributes to the growing body of research on generative AI in art and design education and informs the design of courses and digital learning tools.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07882,Examining students' attitudes and intentions towards using ChatGPT in higher education,"The release of ChatGPT has sparked an immense academic debate regarding its potential advantages and drawbacks for students. Despite its significance, there is a lack of empirical research on students' attitudes and behavioural intentions towards the utilization of ChatGPT. To fill this gap, we employed the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) and used partial least squares structural equation modelling to test the research model by collecting data from 287 university students in the UAE. Our key findings indicate that factors such as performance expectancy and effort expectancy positively influence students' attitudes towards ChatGPT. Additionally, personal development concerns demonstrate a negative association with attitudes and intentions to use ChatGPT, while perceived threat demonstrates a non-significant negative association with both. The findings of this research contribute to the emerging body of literature on ChatGPT's usage both conceptually and empirically. It also offers practical insights for future technology developers, emphasizing the significance of adopting a balanced approach that carefully considers both the benefits and potential drawbacks linked to the utilization of ChatGPT.Practitioner notes What is already known about this topic ChatGPT represents a significant advancement in natural language processing and has gained immense popularity since its launch, with rapid acceptance and adoption across various sectors. In higher education, ChatGPT has seen substantial use among university students and teachers. Previous studies have predominantly focused on investigating the attitudes and behavioural intentions of managers in organizational contexts and academic staff towards technology use in universities. What this paper adds This study addresses an empirical gap by focusing on students' behavioural intentions towards employing ChatGPT, offering a student-centric perspective. It draws upon established technology acceptance literature and employs the integrated AI acceptance-avoidance model (IAAAM) to explore factors shaping students' attitudes and intentions regarding ChatGPT utilization. By adopting a net valence approach, the study considers both positive and negative factors associated with ChatGPT use in higher education. The findings provide valuable insights for educators, students, and policymakers by presenting a balanced and holistic understanding of the multifaceted factors influencing students' attitudes and behavioural intentions. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators can leverage the findings to better understand students' perspectives and design educational strategies that effectively integrate ChatGPT into learning processes. Students can utilize the insights to make informed decisions about incorporating ChatGPT into their academic activities. Policymakers can consider the implications of ChatGPT adoption in higher education and develop guidelines and regulations to ensure its responsible and ethical use.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14171,Youth and ChatGPT: Perceptions of Usefulness and Usage Patterns of Generation Z in Polish Higher Education,"This article examines how young adults in higher education (Generation Z) perceive the usefulness of ChatGPT by analyzing five learning-support roles within the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), Expectation-Confirmation Theory (ECT), and Task-Technology Fit (TTF). Drawing on an online survey of 409 students from Polish universities and nonparametric analyses, this study consistently finds that students rate ChatGPT's potential higher than its current usefulness. The tool is evaluated most favorably as a tutor, task assistant, text editor, and teacher, while its motivational role is rated least effective. Usage patterns matter: students who used ChatGPT for writing tasks rated its assistance with educational assignments more highly, and those who used it for learning activities rated its teaching role more strongly. The strongest evaluations appear when model capabilities such as structuring, summarizing, step-by-step explanations, and personalization align with task requirements. By integrating TAM, ECT, and TTF, this study advances evidence on how Gen Z engages with conversational AI and offers practical guidance for educators, support services, and youth-focused policymakers on equitable and responsible use.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11370,Perspectives of Using Artificial Intelligence as an Automated Knowledge Assessment Instrument,"Knowledge assessment is an integral part of learning and teaching that requires considerable amounts of instructors’ time and effort. This study aims to evaluate the prospects of artificial intelligence (AI) for automated knowledge assessment and identify the factors that influence its perception and value. An experiment with a reference implementation of a grading and automated feedback generation system is performed. Based on the results, a survey with 16 university students who regularly use AI is conducted and analyzed through a thematic analysis method. The findings reveal that availability, knowledge breadth, and elimination of social barriers have positive influence on preference towards AI feedback while specificity, actionability, and encouragement positively influence its perceived usefulness. Excessive length, lack of contextual awareness, and impersonal responses were among the main negative factors. Despite readiness to receive AI feedback, respondents have expressed preference towards feedback from a teacher and revealed the preferred use of AI tools for productivity-enhancing and clerical tasks. The findings confirm that the role of AI in knowledge assessment is in complementing the process rather than substituting the teacher’s role in it. © 2025, University of Southern MIssissippi.

REC_12169,Behavioural Intention to use Artificial Intelligenc(AI) among Accounting Students: Evaluating the Effect of Technology Readiness,"This research examined the factors influencing Malaysian accounting students’ use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) through an extended Technology Acceptance Model. Amid the growing integration of AI in Asia’s accounting sector, this study examined the perceptions and intentions of future professionals toward its use. A cross-sectional, survey-based methodology was employed, targeting third and fourth-year undergraduate students from four prominent Malaysian universities, both public and private. The survey evaluated technology readiness aspects, including optimism, innovativeness, discomfort, and insecurity, alongside superior functionality and perceived usefulness. Data from 136 respondents were analysed using Smart PLS 4, assessing the direct and indirect influences on the behavioural intention to use AI. The results revealed that optimism and innovativeness positively impacted perceptions of AI’s functionality, with optimism additionally affecting perceived usefulness. However, these factors did not significantly enhance the intention to use AI. Notably, superior functionality acted as a crucial intermediary, linking positive perceptions with usage intentions. In contrast, discomfort adversely affected this intention, highlighting it as a significant barrier to AI engagement. The findings highlight the need for curricular updates in accounting education to mitigate technological discomfort and emphasize critical areas for enhanced AI integration and engagement, aligning with technological progress and the profession’s changing demands. © 2025, Universiti Teknologi Mara.

REC_12181,"CHATGPT IN HIGHER EDUCATION, TEACHERS' ATTITUDES AND use","Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI), particularly tools like ChatGPT, is increasingly influencing teaching and research practices in higher education (HE). These developments raise practical and ethical questions relating to academic integrity, assessment, and professional responsibility. This study explores how university teachers perceive and use ChatGPT, focusing on how perceived usefulness and ease of use influence its adoption. The research was conducted at the University of Akureyri in Iceland using a mixed-methods design. Data were collected through an online survey with both closed-and open-ended questions, answered by 23 teachers from two academic departments. The Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) was used to interpret the findings, with attention to core components: perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEOU), attitude toward use (ATU), behavioral intention to use (BIU), and actual use (AU) (Davis, 1989). Most participants had used or were familiar with ChatGPT and described it as useful for academic tasks such as preparing lectures, assignments, feedback, and research-related writing. Perceived usefulness emerged as the strongest predictor of both current and intended use. Ease of use, however, was more unevenly reported. While many found the tool inspiring, others experienced challenges associated with lack of training, vague institutional guidelines, uncertainty about appropriate application and data protection. Teachers with access to support reported more positive experiences and expressed stronger intentions to integrate ChatGPT into their practice. By contrast, the absence of support limited adoption, even among those who saw its potential. Attitudes toward student use were more divided. Concerns were raised about academic integrity, possible overreliance on AI-generated content, and the risk of undermining students' critical thinking and independent learning. Teachers also expressed uncertainty in th of clear policies and expectations. Despite these concerns, ChatGPT was already being used in various ways, particularly for brainstorming, summarising, and drafting content. Many teachers appreciated its time-saving potential and the support it offered in shaping and organising ideas, although they also stressed the importance of critically reviewing its outputs. A recurring theme was the importance of institutional guidance, professional development, and spaces for open discussion. Teachers called for clear expectations, ethical frameworks, and collaborative dialogue as to how GenAI should be integrated into academic practice. This aligns with previous studies emphasising the need to strengthen AI literacy in HE (Francis et al., 2025; Tillmanns et al., 2025). AI literacy was understood not simply as tool but as the ability to engage critically with GenAI, assess the reliability of outputs, and reflect on ethical implications. Without such competencies, there is a risk of shallow adoption that fails to support deep learning or academic integrity. This is in line with UNESCO's guidance (2024), which emphasises human agency, ethical awareness, and social responsibility in AI integration. In conclusion, the study highlights that while university teachers generally acknowledge the value of ChatGPT, its successful integration depends on more than technical access. Perceived usefulness drives adoption, but meaningful and responsible use is shaped by ethical concerns, institutional context, and professional dialogue. There are many opportunities for further research on the use of ChatGPT and other GenAI tools in higher education. It would be interesting to explore how these tools are used in learning and teaching, whether they support traditional practices or introduce innovations. Furthermore, understanding how teaching methods and assessment can evolve with ChatGPT is important to support student learning and reduce dishonest practices. The evolution of learning and teaching with GenAI depends on collective decisions about the purpose and value of education. Teachers play a crucial role in developing guidelines for GenAI use, providing student support, and leading discussions on GenAI in education.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14932,"Student Use, Performance and Perceptions of ChatGPT on College Writing Assignments","ChatGPT is a generative chatbot that conversationally responds to prompts using content mined from the internet. In a very short time, ChatGPT has disrupted many industries, including education. However, the risks and dangers of this technology remain to be seen; for example, students can use ChatGPT dishonestly on writing assignments. Education currently lacks a clear understanding of students’ perspectives and intentions around this technology. In this study, undergraduate students from a comprehensive university were briefed on ChatGPT, given guidelines for its use, encouraged to use this tool on their written assignments and surveyed for their opinions on ChatGPT. We found that a small number of students chose to use ChatGPT and there was no grade difference between students using and not using this tool. Additionally, thematic analysis of student survey responses revealed that while some students viewed ChatGPT as an idea generator and improvement tool for written assignments, others saw it as a way to create submissions for class assignments, potentially infringing on academic integrity. The majority of students felt that ChatGPT should be allowed in college classes and intend to use ChatGPT on future assignments. Finally, most students share misconceptions about ChatGPT, including that it is a source of information and a search engine. Given the rapid rates of adoption of this technology, and its enormous potential for integration across sectors, it is incumbent on educators to deliberately guide and train our students with this tool, while keeping our students’ perspectives and intentions in mind. © 2024, Open Access Publishing Association.

REC_14178,Embracing the unknown and the novel: Can personality traits shape a teacher's approach to ChatGPT?,"This study, conducted in 2024 at a foundation university in Istanbul, Türkiye, examined the relationship between English for Academic Purposes instructors’ personality traits and their integration of ChatGPT into teaching practices. A convergent concurrent mixed-methods design was employed, allowing for the simultaneous collection and separate analysis of quantitative and qualitative data before merging the results for interpretation. In the quantitative phase, 111 English for Academic Purposes instructors were recruited through convenience sampling to complete an online survey measuring their attitudes toward ChatGPT use and personality traits such as Openness to Experience and Ambiguity Tolerance. In the qualitative phase, 8 instructors were selected via purposeful sampling for semi-structured interviews, ensuring variation in personality profiles relevant to the study focus. Quantitative findings indicated that openness, conscientiousness, and ambiguity tolerance significantly influenced instructors’ willingness to integrate ChatGPT into their teaching. Qualitative insights further revealed that while instructors appreciated ChatGPT's support in lesson planning and language instruction, many expressed ethical and pedagogical concerns. These included fears of diminishing student creativity, the risk of overreliance, and the challenge of aligning Artificial Intelligence tools with learning outcomes. The integration of both data sets enabled a richer understanding of how individual personality traits shape educators’ perceptions and use of Artificial Intelligence technologies. The study contributes to ongoing discussions on digital pedagogy by offering practical insights for all stakeholders of education, suggesting that personality-aware strategies may support more thoughtful and effective adoption of Artificial Intelligence in academic contexts. © 2025, Duzce University, Faculty of Education.

REC_02990,"Is generative AI reshaping academic practices worldwide? A survey of adoption, benefits, and concerns","Although generative AI is transforming academic research and education, little is known about the role, gender, international, and disciplinary variations in uptake and use. This 20-country survey of publishing academics shows the widespread awareness and adoption of generative AI tools in academia, but with substantial international and disciplinary differences, and some role and gender differences. In particular, females were 10 % less likely to use Gen AI frequently (daily or weekly) for research, which may exacerbate gender inequalities. Perhaps surprisingly, the highest adoption rates occurred in some non-Western nations, possibly because of a greater need for translation services. The highest awareness is in the social sciences, perhaps because of the greater need for text analysis. Across all groups, these tools were mainly used for academic writing rather than data analysis and support for critical thinking. Despite this, personalized instruction and problem-solving are among generative AI's most generally claimed benefits. However, participants in all groups were skeptical about the creativity, accuracy, and consistency of AI-generated content in academic contexts. The most significant concerns about using generative AI in academia were inaccuracy, plagiarism, discouraging critical thinking, a lack of transparency and explainability, intellectual property rights violations, and data privacy risks.

REC_12195,Research on the Integration Path and Practice of AI Intelligent Technology and English Teaching Reform in Higher Vocational Colleges and Universities,"The application of artificial intelligence technology in language learning, especially English teaching, is subverting the traditional learning mode. This paper discusses in depth the innovative strategies of English practical teaching in higher vocational colleges. It introduces an AI-assisted teaching system that synthesizes the reasoning mechanism, the student independent learning system and the mathematical model of knowledge forgetting. Through practical application, this study verifies the effectiveness of the system. The results showed that the grades of all students who used the AI system and had an average score of more than 60 did not decrease. There was a significant linear relationship between students' engagement and grade improvement, indicating that the more serious the students were, the more influential the grade improvement was. In addition, there is a positive correlation between exam difficulty, passing rate and the number of high scores, and a negative correlation with the number of scores below 60, which verifies the reasonableness of the correlation coefficient. Students' foreign language learning pleasure, burnout and self-efficacy have significant mean differences between the two classes, with p-values less than 0.05, indicating substantial differences. These findings confirm the effectiveness of the AI-assisted teaching system and provide valuable references for future teaching models. © 2023 Junli Yu and Lirong Wang, published by Sciendo.",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11395,Bridging the AI Knowledge Gap: The Urgent Need for AI Literacy and Institutional Support,"The increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education highlights the growing importance of AI literacy among students and educators. AI literacy extends beyond technical proficiency and includes critical thinking, ethical awareness, and the ability to evaluate AI-generated content. Despite its significance, limited research investigates how students perceive AI tools, particularly in resource-constrained and policy-fragmented contexts like South Africa, and what institutional support they require for responsible AI use. This study employs a qualitative research design to analyze survey responses from seventy-eight students, using thematic analysis aligned with Zhou and Schofield’s AI literacy framework. Findings reveal that, while students recognize AI’s potential to enhance learning, they struggle with unclear institutional policies, unequal access to digital resources, and uncertainty about academic integrity when using AI tools. Many students expressed confusion over what constitutes acceptable AI use and called for structured AI literacy programs, clearer guidelines, and active faculty engagement in AI-related training. By applying a globally recognized framework to an underexplored setting, this study offers a localized interpretation of global AI literacy debates, demonstrating how digital inequality, multilingualism, and fragmented policy environments shape student experiences in ways not adequately captured by existing literature. The study recommends that universities embed AI literacy into curricula, establish clear institutional policies on AI-assisted learning, and enhance access to digital resources to foster equitable and responsible AI adoption. These findings contribute to global AI literacy discourse while advancing context-sensitive strategies that respond directly to the realities of South African higher education. © 2025 Common Ground Research Networks.

REC_02997,Assessing students’ intention to adopt generative artificial intelligence,"This study examines the factors that influence the use, adoption, and recommendation of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools among French management science students. Our study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT 3) model by including trust, learning value, and empowerment in learning. This extension fills gaps in our understanding of the psychosocial factors influencing the adoption of GenAI tools in higher education. We used a questionnaire and partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) to analyze data collected from 257 French management science students across different institutions. The results show that the most significant factors are performance expectancy, habit, hedonic motivation, and trust. These factors explain 49.3% of the intention to use GenAI tools, 58.7% of the intention to adopt them, and 39.6% of the intention to recommend them. However, other factors had no significant effect on behavioral intentions. This study contributes to the literature on technology acceptance by extending the UTAUT 3 model to an educational context. Additionally, it provides practical recommendations for educators, policymakers, and technology providers to promote the integration of GenAI tools in management science education and prepare students for future professional environments centred on GenAI tools. © 2025 Elsevier Ltd",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14208,"Generative-AI, a Learning Assistant? Factors Influencing Higher-Ed Students' Technology Acceptance","This study investigates the factors influencing the adoption of Generative-AI tools amongst Thai university students, employing the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) as a theoretical framework. Data from 911 higher education students from 10 different Thai Universities Health Sciences, Sciences and Technology, Social Sciences and Humanities, and Vocational Fields were analysed via Structural Equation Modelling (SEM). The instrument used in collecting the data was a questionnaire. Results indicated that Expected Benefits, Perceived Usefulness, Attitude Toward Technology, and Behavioural Intention all significantly impacted student adoption of Generative AI. Intriguingly, Perceived Ease of Use was negatively correlated with Perceived Usefulness, challenging conventional TAM assumptions. This study underscores the need to address language barriers, foster a culture of innovation, and establish ethical guidelines to promote responsible AI use within education. Despite inherent limitations, this research contributes to our understanding of AI adoption in educational settings and helps inform strategies for equitable access and responsible innovation. The result demonstrated that the easier a tool was to use, the less value leaners seemed to see in it for their learning process. It can be implied that as Generative- AI get more intuitive, learners think they're less helpful. These finding challenges a few of those assumptions we usually make within the TAM model. It also points out the characteristic of learners which affects their learning preferences and expectation. Another finding showed the impact of language barrier on non-native English speaker that obstruct the user experience in AI services. Moreover, the role of universities in fostering both AI integration for learning for and the ethical implementation of Generative AI. By providing a supportive environment that encourages AI experimentation, redesign learning, empowering learners and faculty instructors to investigate how Generative AI can be applied across disciplines, and developing guidelines for ethical use, universities play a critical role in shaping the effective and responsible integration of AI into the next educational landscape.",2024,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11429,“To Use or Not to Use?” A Mixed-Methods Study on the Determinants of EFL College Learners’ Behavioral Intention to Use AI in the Distributed Learning Context,"Artificial intelligence (AI) offers new possibilities for English as a foreign language (EFL) learners to enhance their learning outcomes, provided that they have access to AI applications. However, little is written about the factors that influence their intention to use AI in distributed EFL learning contexts. This mixed-methods study, based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), examined the determinants of behavioral intention to use AI among 464 Chinese EFL college learners. As to quantitative data, a structural equation modelling (SEM) approach using IBM SPSS Amos (Version 24) produced some important findings. First, it was revealed that perceived ease of use significantly and positively predicts perceived usefulness and attitude toward AI. Second, attitude toward AI significantly and positively predicts behavioral intention to use AI. However, contrary to the TAM assumptions, perceived usefulness does not significantly predict either attitude toward AI or behavioral intention to use AI. Third, mediation analyses suggest that perceived ease of use has a significant and positive impact on students’ behavioral intention to use AI through their attitude toward AI, rather than through perceived usefulness. As to qualitative data, semi-structured interviews with 15 learners, analyzed by the software MAXQDA 2022, provide a nuanced understanding of the statistical patterns.

REC_14210,A STIN Model Adoption for Chatbot in Higher Education Online Learning,"This study delves into the adoption of chatbot technology in higher education, with a focus on Indonesian online learning environments. Recognizing the potential of AI-driven tools to address academic support gaps, particularly in developing regions, the research explores how performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and facilitating conditions influence students' behavioral intentions and subsequent adoption of chatbots for academic use. The study employs Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to analyze survey data from a diverse sample of university students, enabling a nuanced understanding of the complex relationships among these factors. The findings reveal that performance expectancy-the belief that chatbots will enhance academic performance and facilitating conditions, such as internet access and institutional support, play significant roles in motivating students to adopt chatbots. However, effort expectancy, or the perceived ease of use, does not directly drive adoption intentions. This suggests that students prioritize practical benefits over user-friendliness, an insight valuable for universities aiming to implement effective chatbot systems. Moreover, the results align with the Socio-Technical Interaction Network (STIN) model, which emphasizes the need for a cohesive social and technical framework to foster technological acceptance. The STIN model's perspective underscores that students' engagement with chatbots is not just a matter of usability but also of how well the technology is supported by the broader educational infrastructure. This study offers actionable insights for Indonesian universities and other institutions in similar contexts, proposing that enhancing campus resources, like reliable internet access and technical support, can drive chatbot adoption. By focusing on performance-based benefits and strengthening the socio-technical environment, universities can effectively integrate AI-based learning tools, addressing both technical and socio-cultural barriers. Such initiatives support students' learning experiences and foster an adaptive academic ecosystem where AI tools serve as essential assets in overcoming resource limitations. Thus, the study contributes a practical roadmap for advancing e-learning in resource-constrained settings through strategic support of AI technology adoption.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07982,From Experience to Adoption: Modelling EFL Learners' GenAI Continuance Through Linear and Configurational Approaches,"As generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) increasingly penetrates language education, understanding learners' continued intention to use this technology becomes crucial. This study examines EFL learners' continuance intention to use GenAI for language learning through PLS-SEM and fsQCA methodologies. Participants were undergraduate EFL learners (N = 383) from three universities in Taiwan, aged 18-24, with varying English proficiency levels (TOEIC 450-860 or CEFR A2-B2). Data were collected through an online survey comprising validated scales measuring technology acceptance constructs and personality traits using 5-point Likert scales. Analysis employed both partial least squares structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) and fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA). Results showed that three key dimensions - dependability, attractiveness and novelty - shape users' overall experience with GenAI, where dependability and attractiveness specifically align with users' initial expectations. Both expectancy confirmation and social influence predict learners' continuance intention. Openness to experience moderates these relationships positively for expectancy confirmation but negatively for social influence, indicating that individuals with high openness prioritise personal evaluation over social cues. As the first study to combine PLS-SEM with fsQCA in GenAI use research, it reveals complementary insights: while PLS-SEM identifies key predictors of continued use, fsQCA uncovers multiple pathways to adoption, with dependability and social influence as core conditions across configurations. This dual-method approach advances theoretical understanding of technology adoption by demonstrating how linear relationships coexist with complex configurational patterns. The findings provide practical implications for educational technology design, emphasising the need to balance system reliability and aesthetic appeal while accounting for individual differences in user personality traits.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12215,Shaping the Future Workforce: Students' Perceptions on AI and Human-Centric Technologies in Industry 5.0,"Research purpose. This paper aims to analyse how university students perceive the role of Artificial Intelligence and human-centric technologies in shaping the future workforce within the context of Industry 5.0. By focusing on students as future professionals, the study explores their expectations, ethical concerns, and readiness for AI-driven transformation in a developing country context.Design / Methodology / Approach. A total of 344 university students from the disciplines of Information Technology, Computer Engineering, and Business Management participated in the study through an online questionnaire. The survey assessed students' knowledge of AI technologies, their perceptions of AI's role in workforce transformation, and their ethical concerns related to AI integration. Data were collected from Bachelor's and Master's students enrolled at public and private higher education institutions in Albania. The study complied with institutional research ethics regulations. As it involved an anonymous, voluntary survey without the collection of sensitive or personally identifiable data, formal ethics committee approval was not required. Spearman's Rank Correlation and descriptive statistics were used to analyse the relationships between AI knowledge, workforce perceptions, and ethical concerns.Findings. The findings reveal that students generally recognize AI's transformative potential in reshaping industries and workforce dynamics, particularly among Information Technology and Computer Engineering students. However, they express scepticism regarding AI's ability to enhance human-centric traits such as creativity and emotional intelligence. A statistically significant positive correlation was found between AI knowledge and perceptions of industrial transformation and skill augmentation, indicating that higher digital literacy is associated with greater optimism about AI's role. Conversely, students who voiced stronger ethical concerns-especially regarding algorithmic bias, privacy, and job displacement-also placed greater emphasis on the need for transparency and explainability in AI systems. These patterns reflect the relevance of both the Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM) and Trust in Automation Theory, underscoring the importance of integrating ethical reasoning with technical training to prepare students for responsible engagement with AI in the context of Industry 5.0.Originality / Value / Practical implications. While student perceptions of AI have been widely examined in global contexts, this study offers a distinct contribution by focusing on Albania-a developing country underrepresented in the AI and Industry 5.0 literature. Its originality lies in the integration of two behavioural frameworks-the Technology Readiness and Acceptance Model (TRAM) and Trust in Automation Theory-to explain students' attitudes toward AI within a human-centric industrial paradigm. The research draws on insights from students in Information Technology, Computer Engineering, and Business Management, integrating both ethical and educational dimensions.

REC_14211,The Role of Learning Motivation Factors in Deepseek Generative AI Adoption among Higher Education Students in India,"This research explores adoption of the Deepseek, an artificial intelligence (AI) platform among higher education students in India by integrating the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with learning motivation factors. Given the rapid rise of AI-based platforms in educational sector, understanding their adoption is not only timely but also essential for ensuring equitable and effective learning outcomes. Addressing a critical research gap in understanding of rapidly evolving EdTech sector, the research blends constructs such as learning interest, achievement goals, self-efficacy, and subjective norms in expanding the typical TAM model. This integrative approach allows for a more holistic framework that captures both technological perceptions and learner-driven motivational factors, making the model especially relevant in emerging economies where educational technology adoption varies widely. Data were gathered using an online survey via Google Forms, providing 346 valid responses from students. The sample consisted of students from diverse academic disciplines, ensures representativeness across different fields of study and thereby enhancing the generalizability of the results. The data was analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) through SmartPLS-3 software. The findings support the extended TAM model which indicated that learning interest and achievement goals have significant impact on perceived ease of use. Self-efficacy and subjective norms have significant impact on perceived usefulness and behavioral intention has significant impact on actual usage, demonstrating its pivotal role in technology adoption. These relationships suggest that motivation-related constructs are not peripheral but central in shaping how students interact with AI-powered platforms. This study advances the literature on educational technology by establishing a new TAM model as applied to AI-powered learning tools in emerging economies. The practical implications are that developers of Deepseek need to make the platform more user-centered in order to increase adoption.

REC_07983,Enhancing Academic Engagement and Needs Satisfaction Through AI: A Mixed-Methods Study in Chinese EFL Tertiary Education Context,"The rapid growth of artificial intelligence (AI) has transformed the educational field by providing efficient assistance for personalised learning. Despite the promising opportunities AI has presented, the impact of AI tools on students' learning outcomes in language learning settings has yet to be further explored, as well as their potential to enhance academic engagement in this specific domain. Therefore, based on the framework of Self-Determination Theory (SDT), this research aims to examine the role of behavioural, cognitive, and emotional engagement in improving students' needs satisfaction specifically among 300 Chinese tertiary learners in the AI-enhanced Chinese EFL context. A mixed-methods approach was used to collect data from Chinese EFL college students, combining self-report surveys and semi-structured interviews. Results from the quantitative data showed that AI perception and academic engagement significantly impact needs satisfaction in AI-enhanced EFL learning. Also, the qualitative findings suggested that while academic engagement and needs satisfaction are critical facilitators for adopting AI-assisted EFL learning, perceived difficulties and unmet needs are significant barriers to long-term usage. Moreover, this study contributes to SDT by highlighting the critical role of academic engagement in enhancing needs satisfaction and offering practical strategies for educators to improve AI application adoption and effectiveness in Chinese educational contexts.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.41,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08953,Decoding the ChatGPT mystery: A comprehensive exploration of factors driving AI language model adoption,"The increasing ubiquity of Artificial Intelligence (AI) chatbots across a variety of sectors has sparked a burgeoning interest in deciphering the determinants that govern their adoption and usage. This study aims to examine the pivotal factors that influence the practical usage of the AI chatbot, ChatGPT, among a sample of university students. Leveraging the theoretical framework of planned behavior, the research model scrutinizes the interplay between knowledge application, perceived intelligence, usability, attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavioral control, trust, behavioral intention, and actual usage. Data procured from a survey of university students were examined through the lens of structural equation modeling. The outcomes reveal that knowledge application, perceived intelligence, and usability have a positive impact on attitudes towards ChatGPT. Perceived intelligence also influences knowledge application, usability, and trust. Concurrently, attitude and subjective norms notably affect behavioral intention. Contrary to expectations, perceived behavioral control did not significantly influence behavioral intention. Trust emerged as a crucial factor steering behavioral intention, which in turn, positively correlates with the actual usage of ChatGPT. These insights enrich the academic discourse on AI chatbot adoption and provide practical implications for AI developers, educators, and policy makers, striving to enhance user engagement with AI systems in educational contexts.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.0,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11444,Health Care Trainees' and Professionals' Perceptions of ChatGPT in Improving Medical Knowledge Training: Rapid Survey Study,"Background: ChatGPT is a powerful pretrained large language model. It has both demonstrated potential and raised concerns related to knowledge translation and knowledge transfer. To apply and improve knowledge transfer in the real world, it is essential to assess the perceptions and acceptance of the users of ChatGPT-assisted training. Objective: We aimed to investigate the perceptions of health care trainees and professionals on ChatGPT-assisted training, using biomedical informatics as an example. Methods: We used purposeful sampling to include all health care undergraduate trainees and graduate professionals (n=195) from January to May 2023 in the School of Public Health at the National Defense Medical Center in Taiwan. Subjects were asked to watch a 2-minute video introducing 5 scenarios about ChatGPT-assisted training in biomedical informatics and then answer a self-designed online (web- and mobile-based) questionnaire according to the Kirkpatrick model. The survey responses were used to develop 4 constructs: perceived knowledge acquisition, perceived training motivation, perceived training satisfaction, and perceived training effectiveness. The study used structural equation modeling (SEM) to evaluate and test the structural model and hypotheses. Results: The online questionnaire response rate was 152 of 195 (78%); 88 of 152 participants (58%) were undergraduate trainees and 90 of 152 participants (59%) were women. The ages ranged from 18 to 53 years (mean 23.3, SD 6.0 years). There was no statistical difference in perceptions of training evaluation between men and women. Most participants were enthusiastic about the ChatGPT-assisted training, while the graduate professionals were more enthusiastic than undergraduate trainees. Nevertheless, some concerns were raised about potential cheating on training assessment. The average scores for knowledge acquisition, training motivation, training satisfaction, and training effectiveness were 3.84 (SD 0.80), 3.76 (SD 0.93), 3.75 (SD 0.87), and 3.72 (SD 0.91), respectively (Likert scale 1-5: strongly disagree to strongly agree). Knowledge acquisition had the highest score and training effectiveness the lowest. In the SEM results, training effectiveness was influenced predominantly by knowledge acquisition and partially met the hypotheses in the research framework. Knowledge acquisition had a direct effect on training effectiveness, training satisfaction, and training motivation, with beta coefficients of .80, .87, and .97, respectively (all P<.001). Conclusions: Most health care trainees and professionals perceived ChatGPT-assisted training as an aid in knowledge transfer. However, to improve training effectiveness, it should be combined with empirical experts for proper guidance and dual interaction. In a future study, we recommend using a larger sample size for evaluation of internet-connected large language models in medical knowledge transfer.",2023,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12224,Implications of Adopting Artificial Intelligence Tools for the University Educational Process,"In a society governed by information and communication technology, the educational needs and aspirations of Generation Z are expressed in increasingly diverse and vivid ways. This diversity in the young generation's perception of education represents the most fertile ground for deep transformations of both the educational process and its associated tools. The field of informatics and economic cybernetics is among the mostflexible in terms of the diversity of educational models, concepts, and tools. In this context, the paradigm of artificial intelligence (AI) in education should no longer be viewed merely as an innovative issue. This paper aims to inventory the specific characteristics of AI integration in education in general, highlighting its benefits and challenges. Furthermore, the study proposes an evaluation model in which five hypotheses are defined and described, focusing on the impact of AI adoption in education. The proposed model is built on the current state of research and is validated using data obtained from a survey conducted in Romania, at the Bucharest University of Economic Studies. The study employs Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM model) to test and analyse the impact of the identified variables on AI use in higher education.

REC_12226,EXPLORING THE ANTECEDENTS OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE PRODUCTS' USAGE. THE CASE OF BUSINESS STUDENTS,"This study aims to investigate to what extent facilitating conditions (those means that users consider necessary to use for a certain technology) and other predictors (perceived risk and lack of trust in technology, gender, education, income, technology proficiency and equipment used to access the Internet) influence the use of Artificial Intelligence Products (AIP) in general and for education. Using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), the data collected, through an online questionnaire from a sample of 450 Romanian business students, were examined using principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic regression. Facilitating conditions indicated a direct effect (positive) on the dependent variables, and the combination between perceived risk and perceived lack of trust in technology displayed an opposite effect (negative) on the dependent variables. Female students showed a greater tendency to use AIPs in general and for education. Undergraduate students were more inclined to use AIPs in general. Students not using smartwatches or personal computers are inclined to use AIPs more in general and for education. This study advances the theory by exploring the actual use of AIPs for educational purposes, developing the UTAUT model by isolating facilitating conditions and using descriptive variables as predictors. At the same time, the present research contributes to enriching the empirical evidence related to UTAUT on the acceptance and use of technology in Romania. The results of the research allow for the formulation of practical recommendations for universities as current and potential providers of AIPs in order to make the educational process more efficient.",2024,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14959,Understanding mobile learning continuance after the COVID-19 pandemic: Deep learning-based dual stage partial least squares-structural equation modeling and artificial neural network analysis,"The influence of COVID-19 on educational processes has halted physical forms of teaching and learning and initiated online and mobile learning systems in most countries. The provision and usage of online and e-learning systems are becoming the main challenge for many universities during the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the novelty of this situation, a substantial amount of research has been carried out to investigate the issue of m-learning adoption or acceptance. Nevertheless, little is known about studying to examine the continued use of m-learning, which is still in short supply and calls for further research. Five different theoretical models are integrated into this study to develop an integrated model that overcomes this limitation, including the technology acceptance model, the theory of planned behavior, the expectation-confirmation model, the Delone and McLean Information System Success Model, and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Utilization of Technology 2. This conceptual framework shows novel relationships between variables by integrating trust, personal innovation, learning value, instructor quality, and course quality. Unlike extant literature, this study utilized a hybrid analysis methodology combining two-stage analysis using partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and evolving artificial intelligence named deep learning (Artificial Neural Network [ANN]) on 250 usable responses. The sensitivity analysis results revealed that attitude has the most considerable effect on the continued use of m-learning, with 100% normalized importance, followed by perceived usefulness (88%), satisfaction (77%), and habit (61%). This research reveals that a “deep ANN architecture” may determine the non-linear relationships between variables in the theoretical model. Further theoretical and practical implications are also discussed. © 2024 by author(s). Environment and Social Psychology is published by Asia Pacific Academy of Science Pte.

REC_11451,Understanding teachers' intentions and use of AI tools for research,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to the development of a wide array of tools which are transforming the education industry. The study investigates the adoption and use of AI tools by teachers within higher education institutions (HEIs), using the context of India. By employing an extended Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model, the study empirically examines the influence of two technological attributes (i.e. performance expectancy and effort expectancy), two contextual factors (i.e. social influence and facilitating conditions) and two personal characteristics (i.e. personal innovativeness and computer self-efficacy) on teachers' behavioral intention to use AI tools for research work. The primary data were collected from 331 teachers working with HEIs in the Delhi- National Capital Region (NCR) of India. PLS-SEM technique was used to analyze the data. The causal model included performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, personal innovativeness, and computer self-efficacy as exogeneous variables; and behavioral intention to adopt AI tools and actual use of AI tools as endogenous variables. The findings indicate that teachers' intention to adopt AI tools for research work is positively influenced by performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, computer self-efficacy and personal innovativeness. Further, their actual use of AI tools is influenced by their behavioral intention and facilitating conditions. The model explained 70.2% variation in behavioral intention and 39.2% variation in actual use of AI tools. The study provides further verification of the effectiveness of the UTAUT framework in the context of using emerging technologies in the education sector.

REC_08958,"What motivates academics in Egypt toward generative AI tools? An integrated model of TAM, SCT, UTAUT2, perceived ethics, and academic integrity","In recent years, the adoption of AI technologies in academia has increased, prompting a need to explain factors driving scholars to adopt or plan to adopt AI technologies in research routines. This study integrates three models into one integrated model: TAM, UTAUT, and SCT. These three models are combined to understand how GenAI self-efficacy, perceived ethics, academic integrity, social influence, facilitating conditions, perceived risks, ease of use, and perceived usefulness influenced the participants' intention to adopt GenAI in research. Following this, data were collected from Egyptian academics linked to Egyptian universities. There were 742 responses to this question. Data were analyzed using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM). The paper's results showed that GenAI self-efficacy, social influence, and perceived ethics are significantly related to perceptions of ease of use, usefulness, and intention to use GenAI. Facilitating conditions have a negative effect on perceived ease of use, and perceived risk does not affect perceived usefulness or intention to use significantly. Notably, the result found that ethics and academic integrity affect perceptions of GenAI's usage and utility. This guide illustrates how universities must take proactive steps to influence how AI will be used and reinforces the importance of using these tools within an ethical lens. This paper emphasizes the need to balance the use of generative AI and ethical practices. It examines the role of ethics and academic integrity in perceptions that influence attitudes toward the use of generative AI. They represent a step forward in our understanding of how to induce AI adoption-in this case, in the academic context, and specifically in Egypt. Additionally, it places sound emphasis on the role of AI technology and how it can be beneficial whilst advocating for a sensible approach in that application, which includes ethical principles.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

EFL learners were selected for this study because language learning involves high levels of emotional engagement, communicative interaction, and cognitive challenge-factors that are especially sensitive to perceived support and self-efficacy in AI-enhanced environments. Building on this foundation, the present study aimed to investigate the complex interactions between teacher support, student self-efficacy, and emotional responses, acknowledging the crucial role these variables play in shaping effective, motivational learning experiences for EFL students. It involved 1115 English as a foreign language (EFL) students from diverse Chinese universities, using convenience sampling for a representative mix of academic levels. Instruments included the teacher support scale (TSS), the college academic self-efficacy scale (CASES), and the emotion scale. Advanced statistical tools like SPSS v27 and AMOS v24 enabled structural equation modelling (SEM) to explore these relationships. Results showed that teacher support and student self-efficacy together explain 57% of emotional variance. Specifically, teacher support alone accounted for 55%, emphasising its role in positive emotional experiences. Student self-efficacy contributed uniquely with 44%, enhancing confidence and motivation in AI-enhanced learning. Overall, the study underscores the significant impact of both teacher support and student self-efficacy on the emotional well-being of EFL students in such learning environments.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

Structural equation modelling based on responses from 233 students in China showed that perceived ease of use significantly predicted perceived usefulness, which in turn influenced attitude and behavioural intention. Among the Big Five traits, conscientiousness positively predicted both perceived usefulness and ease of use; openness and agreeableness positively influenced perceived usefulness; while extraversion and neuroticism significantly affected perceived ease of use in positive and negative directions respectively. The qualitative phase, based on interviews with 15 students, explored how and why these personality traits shaped learners' perceptions and behaviours. Thematic analysis identified key mechanisms such as goal-directed routines (conscientiousness), exploratory curiosity (openness), emotional reassurance (agreeableness), and uncertainty sensitivity (neuroticism).

REC_07987,"Enhancing Teaching Competency in Higher Education: The Role of AI Efficacy, Social Media Use and Classroom Dynamics","The pursuit of enhanced teaching competency in higher education necessitates understanding multifaceted factors that influence effective teaching practices. This study investigated how AI efficacy, social media use and classroom dynamics enhance teaching competency among higher education faculty. Grounded in Bandura's Social Cognitive Theory, we analysed data from 304 university instructors using structural equation modelling. Results reveal that AI efficacy positively influences social media use, which significantly enhances teaching competency. While AI efficacy demonstrates no significant direct impact on teaching competency, its substantial indirect effect through social media use indicates complete mediation. Classroom dynamics, encompassing student engagement patterns, participatory learning environments and interactive teaching methods, emerge as a foundational element that strengthens both social media adoption and overall teaching effectiveness. The collaborative interaction between classroom dynamics and AI efficacy creates optimal conditions for technology-enhanced pedagogical practices. These findings highlight the interconnected roles of AI efficacy, social media engagement and classroom dynamics in fostering teaching excellence. The study offers valuable insights for educational institutions developing comprehensive faculty development programmes that integrate technological competency with pedagogical innovation in higher education settings.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12229,CHALLENGES OF ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ON THE LEARNING PROCESS IN HIGHER EDUCATION,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has expanded to unprecedented proportions in recent decades, penetrating vast areas, including education. The debates on the usefulness of incorporating AI into university education, with its subsequent opportunities and challenges, have captured the attention of the current research agenda. The fruitful exploitation of the AI advantages at the level of Romanian higher education is highly dependent on the specific set of knowledge, competences and abilities, even the capacity of the system to adapt to such a dynamic environment. Consequently, the objective of our research is to identify the skills necessary for the specific digital learning environment of Romanian higher education to encourage students as beneficiaries of the educational act to adopt AI technologies. Thus, our methodology consists of structural equation modelling applied to an original data set collected on the basis of a questionnaire addressed to undergraduate students from higher economic education. Results emphasise that the intention to adopt applications using AI among students directly depend on constructs such as perceived usefulness, attitude towards these technologies, perceived hedonic value, expected performance, or degree of compatibility, while the interactivity of the applications also has an important but indirect influence.",2024,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11463,Students’ behavioral intentions toward generative AI in education: Task-technology fit and moral obligations,"The rapid advancement of generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT, has sparked widespread debate over their impact on academic integrity and educational practices. As these tools become increasingly accessible to students, understanding the factors that influence their adoption in academic settings is essential. The current study explores the application of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools by college students, such as ChatGPT and many others, for completing homework assignments. Drawing on the Task-Technology Fit (TTF) framework and the concept of moral obligation, this research aims to investigate the factors influencing students’ behavioral intentions to use generative AI in academic contexts. Data were collected through an online survey of 136 Taiwanese college students. The results indicate that perceived technology characteristics and self-efficacy significantly enhance task-technology fit, positively affecting behavioral intention. Conversely, moral obligation shaped by perceived teacher attitudes negatively influences students’ intention to use AI tools for coursework. The study employs Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) to test the hypotheses and explains a substantial proportion of the variance in behavioral intention. These findings provide theoretical insights into how technological and ethical considerations jointly influence AI adoption in education. The study also offers practical suggestions for educators and institutions aiming to guide the responsible use of generative AI in learning environments. This study contributes a novel framework for understanding responsible AI use in higher education. © 2025 by the author; licensee Asian Online Journal Publishing Group.

REC_14245,Examining Google Gemini’s acceptance and usage in higher education,"Due to the growing use of chatbots such as ChatGPT and Google Gemini in educational contexts, there is an increasing interest in exploring the perception of students accepting and using Gemini as a unique and effective platform in their educational activities. This research examines the perceptions of Saudi Arabian higher education students towards accepting and using Gemini for academic purposes. Drawing upon the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), a self-administered questionnaire was used; 400 forms were completed and validated for analysis from seven public universities in Saudi Arabia. Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) using SmartPLS was adopted to examine the research hypotheses. The major findings agree with UTAUT and prior studies to some extent in terms of the positive influence of performance expectancy (PE), effort expectancy (EE), and social influence (SI) on students’ intention to utilize Gemini, as well as the influence only of PE on the actual use of Gemini. However, the findings differ from previous research regarding the influence of facilitating conditions (FC) on students’ intention to utilize Gemini; the results were significant but negative. In addition, EE, SI, and FC did not directly affect the actual use of Gemini. These results were due to the lack of valid resources, assistance, and guidance from educational authorities and external sources about the ideal use of Gemini. Furthermore, the findings exposed that BI partially mediates the connection between PE and Gemini’s actual usage and fully mediates between EE and SI and Gemini’s actual usage. © 2024.

REC_14975,Exploring Omani EFL Learners’ Perceptions of AI Tools,"This study employed the Technology Acceptance Model to investigate Omani English as a foreign lan guage (EFL) learners’ perceptions and use of ChatGPT in English learning settings. A predominantly quantitative descriptive design was adopted, using aquestionnaire that included primarily closed-ended itemswith threeopen ended items added to support the quantitative findings. The data were collected from 198 students of two higher education institutions in Oman. Quantitative findings revealed that Omani EFL learners used ChatGPT both inside and outside class for learning English, mainly for obtaining explanations for unclear concepts and ideas, obtain ing answers for English exercises, grammar correction and support, and idea generation. The correlation analysis shows that more frequent and longer use of ChatGPT was associated with a wider range of English learning pur poses. The learners reported strong ease of use, positive attitudes towards ChatGPT, and an intention to pursue using it. The qualitative findings supported the quantitative results, emphasizing that ChatGPT improved learners’ performance in terms of grammar, writing fluency, vocabulary building, confidence and learning autonomy. How ever, the qualitative findings revealed some concerns about overreliance, accuracy, limited contextual depth, and academic integrity. Both sets of findings suggest that while Omani EFL learners are ready to adopt and integrate ChatGPT into EFL learning, they are cautious about the unguided use of it. Future research may extend this work to examine the long-term impact of ChatGPT on EFL learners across a wider range of higher education institutions within and beyond the Sultanate of Oman. © 2025, UK Scientific Publishing Limited, All rights reserved.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07990,"Emotion-Aware AI in Physical Education: Investigating Affective Computing's Role in Motivation, Regulation, and Self-Efficacy","Understanding the role of emotion in student learning has become increasingly important in educational research, particularly in physically demanding disciplines such as Physical Education (PE), where motivation, confidence, and emotional resilience are critical for performance and engagement. Despite this, limited attention has been given to how artificial intelligence (AI), especially affective computing, can support these emotional and motivational processes within PE contexts. This study investigated the predictive power of AI-enabled affective computing on four key psychological constructs among undergraduate PE students: motivation, emotional regulation, academic self-efficacy, and control-value appraisals. A total of 409 PE students from Henan Province, China, participated. Structural equation modelling (SEM) was employed to examine the relationships between AI-driven emotional responsiveness and students' psychological outcomes in AI-supported PE learning environments. AI-enabled affective computing significantly and positively predicted all four variables. The strongest effect was observed for academic self-efficacy, followed by motivation, emotional regulation, and control-value appraisals. The SEM explained 67% of the variance in emotional regulation and 62% in self-efficacy, with robust model fit indices supporting the validity of the findings. These results highlight the potential of integrating emotionally responsive AI tools into PE programmes to create learner-centred, adaptive environments. Such integration can enhance emotional wellbeing, strengthen academic confidence, and promote sustained physical engagement among students.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11498,Readiness Towards Artificial Intelligence Among Undergraduate Medical Students in Malaysia,"Artificial intelligence (AI) technology is growing at a fast pace and permeates many aspects of people’s daily lives. Medical students’ inclination towards AI in the medical field increases the probability of successful AI adoption and its value in the medical field. This study was conducted to evaluate medical AI readiness among undergraduate medical students. A cross-sectional study was conducted from March 2022 to April 2022 in a private medical institution in Malaysia. A non-probability purposive sampling method was used to enroll students and a questionnaire was distributed online via Google Forms. The questionnaire, captioned “Medical Artificial Intelligence Readiness Scale for Medical Students (MAIRS-MS)”, was used for data collection. The analysis included frequency tables, percentages, standard deviation, unpaired t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) test. Out of 105 participants, 67.62% scored 53 to 83, followed by 24.76%, who scored 84 to 114, and 7.62%, who scored 22 to 52 on the medical AI readiness scale. The mean of the total score of medical AI readiness obtained was 75.04. There were significant correlations between age and study year with the ability, vision, and ethics domains of medical AI readiness. A significant association was observed between previous training with all four domains of medical AI readiness. Policymakers and the educational sector should set up more AI training centers to provide and introduce basic courses on AI.

REC_14248,"Student acceptance of ChatGPT in higher education: A mixed-method study of attitudes, intentions, and concerns","ChatGPT has become a widely accessible tool for university students, yet the factors influencing its acceptance or hesitation remain underexplored. This study investigates undergraduate students’ attitudes, intentions, and behaviors toward using ChatGPT in higher education, using a mixed-method design with the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM). A revised TAM survey, incorporating constructs such as Perceived Ease of Use, Perceived Usefulness, Attitude, Behavioral Intention, and Actual Use, was administered to 687 students across nine institutions during December 2024. Results indicate that students who perceive ChatGPT as useful exhibit more positive attitudes, leading to stronger Behavioral Intentions and higher Actual Use for academic tasks outside the classroom. Additionally, open-ended responses and interviews highlighted both benefits and concerns. Key benefits included time savings, ease of information gathering, and enhanced creativity. Concerns focused on a lack of understanding of ChatGPT’s functionalities, fear of over-reliance, mistrust of generated content, and risks to academic integrity. These findings suggest that while many students recognize ChatGPT’s potential as a study aid, challenges related to user education and ethical use must be addressed. This study contributes to the growing discourse on AI integration in higher education by offering evidence-based insights and practical strategies for leveraging ChatGPT as an effective, ethical tool to support student learning in higher education. © 2025.

REC_03272,Integrating trust and satisfaction into the UTAUT model to predict Chatbot adoption – A comparison between Gen-Z and Millennials,"This paper examines the key determinants of behavioral intention, user satisfaction, and chatbot adoption among urban, college-educated student populations within Generation Z and Millennials in India. While Millennials grew up with the Internet, Gen Z was born into the era dominated by social media and smartphones, making them inherently tech-savvy and drawn to chatbots for information access. This study extends the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) by integrating technological elements with trust and satisfaction to propose a conceptual model. Using a mixed-method approach, data were collected through a cross-sectional online survey of 487 chatbot users from urban educational institutions in India. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) was used to test 11 hypothesized direct relationships. The results suggest that users' willingness to adopt chatbots is significantly influenced by performance expectancy, social influence, trust, and satisfaction. Regarding user satisfaction, both facilitating conditions and trust played substantial roles. Additionally, this study found meaningful associations between facilitating conditions, satisfaction, intention, and adoption. Multi-group analyses revealed notable differences in chatbot adoption factors between Gen Z and Millennials within the study's sampled population. Given the importance of trust in chatbot adoption, the paper highlights that reducing perceived risks can strengthen trust, enhance user satisfaction, and drive chatbot intention and adoption. The above findings offer context-specific insights for chatbot providers in devising strategies to improve user trust, satisfaction, and adoption within similar demographics. © 2025",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The explosive growth of GenAI in design practice demands that design educators ensure students are prepared to enter the design profession with the knowledge and experience of using GenAI. To facilitate GenAI’s introduction in a project-based context, it is suggested that design educators use critical engagement as a starting point to assure students understand the strengths and weakness of GenAI in the creative design process. There is little guidance on how to systematically integrate GenAI in design studio practice while maintaining a critical perspective of the ethical issues it has engendered. This research explores student attitudes toward GenAI, frequency of its use, and student perception of its impact on their future design careers. A survey of a representative cohort of graphic design students (n = 17) reveals a pragmatic acceptance that GenAI will change how design is practiced and a concurrent willingness to learn more on how to use it effectively and ethically. The survey validates the need for design educators to engage and guide students critically in their understanding and use of GenAI within studio and professional practice. © 2024 Katja Fleischmann.",2024,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12264,Understanding ChatGPT dependency in Science student learning: a structural model approach,"ChatGPT, an AI-based tool for generating text responses, has become popular among university students to aid in understanding complex subjects. This study explores factors influencing ChatGPT adoption among Indonesian science students, focusing on ease of use (EU), perceived usefulness (PU), hedonic motivation (HM), satisfaction of use (SU), and dependency of use (DU). A quantitative method was used to collect data from 205 students across 22 provinces via convenience sampling, analyzed using “Partial Least Squares - Structural Equation Modeling” (PLS-SEM). Results show that the EU significantly affects SU but not DU. PU and HM significantly influence SU and DU, indicating their key roles. However, SU does not significantly affect DU, suggesting that satisfaction alone does not drive dependency. These findings highlight the importance of balanced ChatGPT integration in education to support learning without encouraging over-reliance.

REC_14984,"Adoption ChatGPT in higher education settings: Potentials, challenges, and paving the way for future advancements","Several artificial intelligence generative language models have been developed recently. Many people in different contexts have started using them, such as education, industry, and even content creation. This study focuses on investigating how higher education students have been using ChatGPT as an example of a generative artificial intelligence tool. The context of the study was chosen due to the many voices against or in favor of using ChatGPT in higher education institutions. We deployed a mixed method to collect and analyze the data, including open-ended and closed-ended question surveys, to investigate the motivations and future expectations of students who have been using the ChatGPT tool. The research methodology comprises two main components: the initial phase involves conducting statistical analyses on questions about each of the 15 adoption factors. Responses concerning each factor were meticulously compiled and transferred into an Excel spreadsheet. Subsequently, the frequency of responses for each choice was tallied to discern prevailing trends and preferences among respondents. The second phase focuses on analyzing the open-ended questions' responses that forecast the future of ChatGPT as perceived by the participants. The data gathered from open-ended questions was analyzed thematically using Miles and Huberman's approach. Our findings reveal that students generally find using ChatGPT to be a helpful tool in their higher education institutions. The findings show that ease of use, perceived value, trialability, observability, relative advantage, social impact, and network effect are the most important factors behind their adoption decision. The findings also revealed that a significant number of students are still confused about ethical concerns and report the need for regulations when using ChatGPT. These findings are important for educators, policymakers, and technology designers who want to make the most of generative AI in education. Future research, however, is yet to be conducted to understand its ethical implications, long-term effects, and how to best incorporate it into teaching practices. © 2025 by the authors; licensee Learning Gate.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.32,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_07998,Uncovering the Mediating Effects of AI Trust and Self-Efficacy on Engagement in Human-GenAI Communication for EFL Learning,"Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) offers robust information generation, swift responsiveness and high personalization for education. However, it remains unclear how these specific technological features translate into improved learning engagement through the mediation of learners' psychological states. Grounded in the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) theory, this study investigates the mediating roles of AI trust and AI learning self-efficacy in the relationships between GenAI features (responsiveness and personalization) and the learning engagement of English as a Foreign Language (EFL) learners. This study surveyed 697 undergraduate students from four universities in China, all of whom had used GenAI to assist their EFL learning. Using structural equation modelling, the results revealed that: (1) Both responsiveness and personalization significantly enhanced learners' AI trust and self-efficacy; (2) These psychological states, in turn, positively influenced learning engagement; (3) A critical divergence was observed: responsiveness influenced engagement only indirectly through the full mediation of trust and self-efficacy, whereas personalization exerted both a direct effect and indirect effects through the same mediators. This study elucidates the distinct psychological pathways through which different AI features affect engagement, providing a more nuanced theoretical account. The findings underscore that for AI tools to foster deep engagement, they must be designed not only to be responsive and personalised but also to proactively build learners' trust and confidence in their AI-use capabilities.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_09002,Video learning and artificial intelligence (AI) in mechanical engineering education: A student perspective,"This paper investigates the transformative impact of video learning and artificial intelligence (AI) on enhancing the learning experience in mechanical engineering education. Through a quantitative and qualitative study using a survey, 145 undergraduate mechanical engineering students at the Faculty of Engineering of University of Porto, Portugal, provided insights into their utilization and perceptions of video learning and AI-based tools. The results showed a widespread acceptance and utilization of video resources as supplementary learning aids, particularly for reinforcing understanding of complex concepts in engineering subjects. Moreover, students recognize AI's potential to revolutionize traditional education systems. Unlike traditional video learning, AI offers innovative solutions to enhance interactive learning experiences for students. However, while video learning is often employed for comprehending complex subjects, AI-based tools, despite their interactive nature, are currently considered more advantageous for addressing less intricate topics. Challenges and ethical considerations surrounding the integration of AI in education are also addressed. The study underscores the need for educators to strike a balance between technological innovation and traditional pedagogical approaches to ensure that AI and video learning enrich rather than replace the learning experience. Ultimately, by increasing the strengths of AI and video learning, educators can cultivate engaged, empowered, and proficient mechanical engineering graduates prepared to navigate the complexities of the modern technological landscape. © The Author(s) 2025.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.3,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_11505,Examining Canadian Undergraduates’ Perspectives with Using GenAI for Learning; Examen des perspectives des personnes étudiantes canadiennes de premier cycle concernant l'utilisation de l'IA générative pour l’apprentissage,"The rapid emergence of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools presents new opportunities and challenges for higher education, yet little is known about how undergraduate students choose to engage with these technologies. This study examined Canadian undergraduates’ perspectives on GenAI as a learning support across three phases of the lecture cycle: before, during, and after class. Using a mixed-format survey (N = 296), we analyzed 118 student-written responses through Mayring’s qualitative content analysis and mapped themes onto Zimmerman’s model of Self-Regulated Learning (SRL). Results indicate that students see GenAI as a versatile cognitive partner—supporting preparation before lectures, engagement and clarification during, and review and assignment help afterward. Students also expressed critical concerns about overreliance, accuracy, academic integrity, and data privacy, which align with vulnerabilities in SRL processes such as self-control, self-evaluation, and help-seeking. Findings highlight a conceptual shift from institutional framings of GenAI as a production tool toward student framings of GenAI as a mechanism for intellectual capacity building. We argue that deliberate integration of GenAI into teaching practices and institutional policies—aligned with SRL subprocesses—can support responsible, student-informed adoption. The study contributes timely evidence for educators and policymakers navigating the pedagogical and ethical dimensions of GenAI in postsecondary learning. © 2024 Ann-Kathrin Grenz, Soroush Sabbaghan, Michele Jacobsen.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_14281,Readiness and foresighting of higher learning institutions for large language model in Zanzibar: A student perspective,"Generative Artificial intelligence systems, including large language models, are transforming higher education by providing real-time academic support, facilitating student engagement, and enabling personalized learning. As these technologies expand globally, understanding the preparedness of Zanzibar’s higher education institutions to adopt them is essential. This study explores students’ perspectives on institutional preparedness to integrate large language models into teaching, learning, and academic support systems. A qualitative design was employed, combining online surveys with roundtable discussions to assess students’ access to technology, awareness of Generative AI, and their perceptions of its impact on educational settings. The findings show that 97.7% of students have access to essential technologies such as smartphones and internet connectivity, despite instability on some campuses. A significant majority of students demonstrate familiarity with Generative AI, and approximately 83% use it comfortably. Students perceive AI as beneficial for self-directed learning, academic performance, and career development. However, they also raised concerns about the accuracy of AI-generated content, the risk of plagiarism, and a potential decline in critical thinking. Institutional readiness varies widely: while students exhibit high awareness, institutions face challenges related to insufficient training, the absence of guidelines, and a lack of comprehensive ethical frameworks. The study underscores the need for a balanced, student-centered, and collaborative approach to integrating Generative AI in higher education.

REC_08000,A Study on Chinese College Students' Intention to Use Toward AI Chatbots: Integrating Innovation Diffusion Theory and Technology Acceptance Model,"Despite the considerable potential of artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots, existing research has predominantly emphasised technical aspects, lacking empirical investigation from the perspective of user willingness, particularly among college students. To address this gap, this study integrates the Technology Acceptance Model and the Innovation Diffusion Theory to explore the key factors influencing Chinese college students' intention to use AI chatbots. Specifically, it examines how the features of AI chatbots, such as relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, observability, perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use and interactivity, affect college students' attitude (ATT) and intention to use. Data from 1533 valid responses, collected via an online survey in China's Hunan Province, were analysed using Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) via Smart-PLS 4 software. The results indicated that the proposed factors collectively explain 70.2% of the variance in intention to use, with ATT exerting a significant positive influence. Perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use emerged as the strongest predictors of ATT, while the features of AI chatbots (compatibility, trialability, observability, interactivity) significantly affected perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. In contrast, relative advantage showed no significant impact. This study empirically validates an integrated model of Innovation Diffusion Theory and Technology Acceptance Model, highlighting the driving effects of features such as perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use on ATT and intention to use. Based on these findings, strategic recommendations are provided for developers, higher education institutions, and educators to optimise AI chatbot design and facilitate their deeper integration into pedagogical contexts.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08001,"Flow, Psychological Needs, and Behavioral Intention in AI-Assisted Learning: Evidence From Music Education","This study investigates how flow experience influences students' intention to continue using AI-assisted learning tools, with a focus on the mediating role of three basic psychological needs (autonomy, competence, and relatedness) as conceptualized by Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Drawing on data from 941 university-level music students who had experience using AI-supported music learning platforms, the study employed structural equation modeling (SEM) to test a hypothesized motivation pathway. Results revealed that flow did not directly predict behavioral intention, but its effects were transmitted indirectly through autonomy and relatedness. Competence, however, did not significantly mediate the relationship. These findings suggest that learners' engagement with AI systems is sustained not merely by momentary immersion but by the satisfaction of deeper psychological needs. The study extends motivational theories in the field of AI-supported education and offers practical guidance for designing psychologically supportive intelligent learning systems.",2025,WoS,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.8,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

The cross-sectional study is based on responses collected from 578 students selected through convenience sampling at a university in Nepal through a structured questionnaire. Using PLS-SEM, the study found that habit (beta = 0.315, p < 0.001), learning value (beta = 0.254, p < 0.001), and social influence (beta = 0.127, p < 0.001) were the significant factors positively affecting students' intention to use ChatGPT. In contrary, effort expectancy, hedonic motivation, facilitating conditions, and performance expectancy did not significantly influence intention to use. The study extended the UTAUT2 model by incorporating information accuracy as a moderating variable. However, information accuracy of ChatGPT did not moderate the hypothesized relationships. This study provides valuable insights for intention to use ChatGPT in education, with a unique focus on the moderating role of information accuracy.

REC_15024,Influence of Self-Efficacy in the Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Anxiety Toward AI Use on AI Dependence Among Peruvian University Students; Influencia de la autoeficacia en el uso de la inteligencia artificial (IA) y la ansiedad hacia el uso de la IA en la dependencia de la IA entre estudiantes universitarios peruanos,"Introduction: the advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) in education has transformed the way students interact with technological tools, creating new challenges related to self-efficacy, anxiety, and AI dependence. Self-efficacy refers to one’s confidence in their ability to use AI, while AI-related anxiety pertains to the fear or concern when interacting with these systems. These variables can influence technological dependence, affecting academic performance and emotional well-being. Objective: this study aims to examine the influence of self-efficacy in AI use and anxiety toward AI on AI dependence among Peruvian university students. Method: a descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted with 528 Peruvian university students aged 18 to 37 years (M = 19,00, SD = 3,84). Scales were used to measure AI self-efficacy, anxiety toward AI, and AI dependence. Correlation and multiple regression analyses were applied to identify predictors of technological dependence. Results: the results showed that AI self-efficacy was positively correlated with AI anxiety (r = 0,43, p <,01) and AI dependence (r = 0,61, p <,01). Anxiety also significantly correlated with AI dependence (r = 0,71, p <,01). Multiple regression analysis revealed that both AI anxiety (β = 1,131, p <,001) and AI self-efficacy (β = 0,610, p <,001) predicted AI dependence. Additionally, business administration students exhibited greater dependence compared to students from other fields (β = 1,025, p <,05). Conclusions: students with higher self-efficacy in AI use tend to utilize AI more frequently but also experience greater anxiety and dependence on AI. Educational interventions should focus on reducing AI-related anxiety to prevent excessive dependence, especially among students. © 2025; Los autores.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.7,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_03420,Near-Peer Tutoring for Surgical Examination Preparation for Final Year Exam Readiness (Project SEPFYR),"BACKGROUND: Traditional surgical education often lacks targeted preparation for the interactive components of examinations, such as viva voce and objective structured clinical examination (OSCE) assessments. We present our approach and explore the efficacy of a near- peer tutoring program aimed at enhancing final-year students' readiness for such assessments. METHODS: Project SEPFYR (surgical exam prep for final year exam readiness) was conducted within a near-peer tutoring framework and comprised interactive discussions of selected case scenarios focusing on viva voce techniques and OSCE responses. Pre- and post-program anonymized web-based surveys were employed to assess perceived self-efficacy among participants, while the Stanford Faculty Development Program-26 (SFDP-26) tool was used to evaluate the performance of tutors. RESULTS: Near-peer tutoring intervention resulted in improvements in perceived self-efficacy scores among final-year students. Additionally, tutors demonstrated high-quality facilitation skills as evaluated by the SFDP26. CONCLUSIONS: Near-peer tutoring is a promising approach to enhance surgical examination readiness, particularly in addressing interactive assessment components. This model fosters a supportive learning environment while leveraging the expertise and relatability of near-peer tutors. ( J Surg Ed 81:1618-1622.- 1622.

REC_11624,A Novel Scale to Measure Nursing Students’ Fear of Artificial Intelligence: Development and Validation,"Background: The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in healthcare is revolutionizing patient care and clinical practice, enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and accessibility. However, it has also sparked concerns among nursing students about job displacement, reliance on technology, and the potential loss of human qualities like empathy and compassion, to this date, there is no established scale measuring the level of fear, especially among nursing students. Aim: To develop and validate a scale to assess nursing students' fear of artificial intelligence. Methods: The current study employed a cross-sectional design, involving a total of 225 Saudi nursing students enrolled in a nursing college. The scale's construct, convergent, and discriminant validity were evaluated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Results: A comprehensive review of the literature addressing fear of AI guided the development of the Fear Towards Artificial Intelligence Scale (FtAIS). An initial pool of items was subjected to a content validity assessment by an expert panel, which refined the scale to 10 items categorized into two dimensions: job issues and humanity. The two-factor structure was responsible for 73.52% of the total variance. The scale items' reliability was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha coefficient, yielding a value of 0.803. The reliability coefficients for the two subscales, job issues, and humanity, are 0.804 and 0.801, respectively. The confirmatory factor model demonstrated a good model fit. The scale's convergent and discriminant validity were both confirmed. Conclusion: The FtAIS is a rigorously developed and validated tool for measuring nursing students' fears toward AI. These findings emphasize the need for targeted educational interventions and training programs that could mitigate AI-related fears and prepare nursing students for its integration into healthcare. The scale offers practical applications for educators and policymakers in addressing AI fear and fostering its confident adoption to enhance patient care and healthcare outcomes. © 2025 The Author(s).

REC_03424,Innovative Learning in Anatomy Education: Assessing the Impact of Low-Cost 3D Deep Learning Anatomical Models in Museum-Based Instruction,"BACKGROUND: Anatomy education traditionally relies on cadaveric dissection and static models, which can be costly, ethically complex, and limited in interactivity, hindering students' ability to grasp clinical correlations and spatial relationships. This study evaluates the effectiveness of a virtual anatomy museum approach, leveraging low-cost, interactive 3D models and deep learning, to enhance clinical reasoning and anatomical understanding among medical undergraduate students. METHODOLOGY: In this non-experimental, observational study, designed as a proof of concept, 40 undergraduate students from the Bachelor of Applied Medical Sciences program at King Khalid University are divided into Target (n = 20) and Control (n = 20) groups based on pre-assigned enrolment numbers. The Target Group engages with a web-based virtual anatomy museum platform featuring interactive 3D anatomical models (e.g., brain, spine, knee) in a museum-like environment over a 15-week semester, fostering exploration and clinical understanding. The platform, powered by a PointNeXt deep learning backbone and AnatoVision Block, provided interactive visualization, annotations, and quizzes. The platform provides interactive features, such as rotating models to examine structures like the cerebellum for neurological assessments or the femur for fracture diagnosis, along with clear labels and quizzes. The Control Group receives traditional lecture-based instruction supplemented with 3D-printed anatomical models, serving as a baseline to contextualize the Target Group's experience rather than a direct comparator, given the qualitative differences between interactive digital and lecture-based approaches with physical models. Post-intervention, students' clinical reasoning and anatomical proficiency are assessed using case-based questionnaires targeting 5 dimensions: acceptance, clinical problem-solving creativity, motivation, knowledge gain, and communication skills. Students also rate their experience via a 5-point Likert scale questionnaire, providing insights into the platform's potential to enhance anatomy education in resource-limited settings. RESULTS: The Target Group scored significantly higher (mean 4.48 0.66) than the Control Group (mean 3.45 0.70) in overall performance (p < 0.01). Notable improvements were observed in anatomical understanding (95% vs. 65%, p = 0.01), clinical scenario interpretation (90% vs. 70%, p = 0.02), and motivation (85% vs. 50%, p = 0.05). Most Target Group students (92%, n = 18) agreed that the virtual 3D models enhanced clinical relevance, spatial orientation, and interdisciplinary communication, with 100% recommending its curriculum integration. Technical difficulties were reported by 25% of the Target Group (p = 0.49). CONCLUSION: The virtual anatomy museum approach, utilizing low-cost, interactive 3D models, demonstrates strong potential to enhance clinical reasoning and anatomical proficiency among medical students at King Khalid University. The platform, explored as a proof of concept, fosters skills critical for clinical practice, such as identifying cranial sutures for neuroimaging or planning surgical corridors for hip replacements, offering a scalable, engaging supplement to medical education in resource-limited settings. The Target Group's experience, contextualized against a Control Group receiving lecture-based instruction with 3D-printed models, highlights the platform's ability to support hands-on learning.

REC_08052,Exploring AI Literacy and AI-Induced Emotions among Chinese University English Language Teachers: The Partial Least Square Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) Approach,"Despite artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a key driver of innovation and transformation in language education, how to enhance language teachers' AI literacy and understand their emotional experiences in AI-mediated teaching remains largely unexplored. Drawing upon Appraisal Theory, this study seeks to uncover the interplay between language teachers' AI literacy and their emotional responses. Data were collected from 148 English as a foreign language (EFL) teachers at universities and colleges in China through an online questionnaire. Partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was employed to examine the effects of four dimensions of AI literacy, including Knowing and Understanding AI (KUAI), Applying AI (AAI), Evaluating AI Applications (EAIA), and AI Ethics (AIE), on three types of emotions: enjoyment, anger, and anxiety. The results revealed significant positive correlations between the four dimensions of AI literacy and the three types of AI-induced emotions. Furthermore, AAI and EAIA were found to positively predict teachers' enjoyment, while EAIA also positively predicted teachers' anger. However, KUAI and AIE did not predict any of the AI-induced emotional outcomes, and none of the four dimensions of AI literacy were found to predict anxiety. This study highlights the necessity of targeted interventions, paving the way for more comprehensive teacher training programs and policy initiatives that equip educators with both technical knowledge and emotional resilience in AI-mediated teaching environments, thereby supporting their effective and ethical adoption of AI.

REC_11662,Adoption of generative AI in higher education: Understanding usage through a technology acceptance model,"The aim of this study is to examine the adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) tools among faculty in higher education using a revised Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) model. A quantitative survey was conducted with 244 faculty members from eight Saudi universities, and the data were analyzed through Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS. The results show that Performance Expectancy (PE), Effort Expectancy (EE), Social Influence (SI), Facilitating Conditions (FC), and Behavioral Intention (BI) significantly influence the adoption of GenAI tools. Among these, PE and EE had the strongest positive impact on BI, stressing the importance of user-friendly design and faculty training, while SI had a weaker but still meaningful effect. Gender and academic position were also found to moderate adoption behaviors, indicating differences across faculty groups. This study extends the UTAUT model by introducing new moderating factors and provides empirical evidence from Saudi Arabia. It further recommends intuitive system design, technical support, training, and the development of an AI-friendly academic culture to promote effective integration of GenAI in higher education.",2025,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.5,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_12314,Analyzing TPACK and Demographic Influences on Faculty Adoption of ChatGPT in Latin American Higher Education,"The rapid integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT into higher education worldwide has created an urgent need for faculty to develop the necessary skills and knowledge to use these tools effectively and ethically. This study explores the way in which university faculty in Peru apply the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework when using ChatGPT for educational purposes. A cross-sectional survey of 180 instructors revealed that higher TPACK levels are moderately linked to more frequent and purposeful use of ChatGPT, although demographic factors such as gender, age, and prior AI training also play significant roles. The resultsults highlight that while TPACK provides a useful foundation, it may not fully predict how successfully faculty members will adopt generative AI, underscoring the need to expand this framework with AI-specific competencies. These findings offer practical insights for designing faculty development programs and institutional policies that foster responsible and effective AI integration in higher education. ©Authors.",2025,Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.6,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)

REC_08054,Measuring Motivation for Generative AI-based Language Learning: Scale Development and Validation Based on the Self-Determination Theory,"The accelerating use of generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in language learning calls for the development of theory-driven measurement instruments. For this reason, the current study aims to develop and validate a motivation scale for GenAI-based language learning, grounded in the self-determination theory (SDT). The data were collected twice from two independent groups of EFL learners in two universities. Exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and test-retest analyses were conducted on the data from the first participant group. Confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and correlational analyses for the criterion validity were conducted through the data from the second participant group. The reliability analyses were conducted separately on the data from both participant groups. The findings revealed that the developed scale demonstrated a valid and reliable measurement model with both groups of participants. In conjunction with the self-determination theory, it has 17 items with three factors: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. The findings also revealed that these factors are highly associated with the dimensions of generative AI acceptance. It was concluded that the scale can be used as a valid and reliable instrument to measure EFL learners' motivation for generative AI-based language learning within diverse learning environments, including face-to-face, open, distance, and blended learning.

REC_14407,Influencing Factors of College Students' Willingness to Use Mobile Online Education Platforms,"With the continuous progress of artificial intelligence technology, mobile online education is developing rapidly. Compared with traditional classrooms, the mobile online education mode can realize sharing of high-quality education resources efficiently and at a low cost, thus the education informatization policy can be implemented. However, the college students' willingness to use mobile online education platforms is complicated due to the lack of a market access threshold and relatively single course resources. Based on the theory of perceived value, the hypothesis of the influencing factors of the college students' willingness to use mobile online education platforms was proposed, and the hypothesis with a questionnaire survey method and structural equation model was verified. Results show that the questionnaire designed in this study has good reliability and validity. The exploratory learning and good public praise of the network positively affects the college students' perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of mobile online education platforms. The perceived usefulness has a significant direct and positive effect on their willingness to use online education platforms. The conclusions have a certain reference value for improving the quality and service of online education platforms and enriching the connotation and usage of mobile online education.",2021,WoS; Scopus,uncertain,uncertain,0.0,0.09,,,"codex failed: OpenAI Codex v0.101.0 (research preview)
