"College Teachers’ Behavioral Intention to Adopt Artificial Intelligence-Assisted Teaching Systems","W. Zhang; Z. Hou","Guangzhou Huashang College, Guangzhou, China; Guangzhou Huashang College, Guangzhou, China",IEEE Access,"23 Oct 2024","2024","12","","152812","152824","Given the extensive application of artificial intelligence (AI) within the educational domain, college teachers’ behavioral intention to adopt AI-assisted teaching systems (AIATS) has emerged as a critical topic, with gaps in the breadth of samples and the diversity of methods. To further delve into the principal elements affecting college teachers’ inclination towards AIATS, this research constructs an integrative theoretical framework that synthesizes the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with the Innovation Diffusion Theory (IDT), while comprehensively considering internal and external factors. The investigation collected sample data from a questionnaire survey, which reached 529 college teachers in China, and undertook data analysis employing SPSS 27.0 and AMOS 26.0. The findings revealed that: 1) college teachers’ behavioral intention to embrace AIATS is directly and significantly shaped by perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, trust and subjective norms; 2) factors such as observability, relative advantage and compatibility indirectly impact college teachers’ adoption willingness of AIATS through their perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness; 3) complexity of AIATS positively affects perceived ease of use by means of perceived time cost, thereby influencing behavioral intention; 4) sociocultural factors significantly impact the adoption and promotion of AIATS in China. By extending the applicability of TAM and IDT within the realm of educational technology acceptance, this study offers strategic recommendations geared towards educational policymakers and technology developers to promote the implementation of AIATS, and sheds light on educational technology adoption across diverse sociocultural landscapes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3445909","Guangdong Province Education Science “13th Five-Year Plan” 2020 Annual Project of China(grant numbers:2020GXJK439); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10639410","AI-assisted teaching systems (AIATS);generative AI;technology acceptance model (TAM);innovation diffusion theory (IDT);sociocultural factors;perceived time cost","Education;Artificial intelligence;Technological innovation;Complexity theory;Observability;Generative AI;Technology acceptance model;Cultural aspects;Social factors","","17","","83","CCBYNCND","19 Aug 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Creating a Novel Approach to Examine How King Saud University’s Arts College Students Utilize AI Programs","A. S. Almogren","Department of Visual Arts, College of Arts, King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia",IEEE Access,"17 Apr 2025","2025","13","","63895","63917","One of the cutting-edge ideas that is essential to improving students’ behavioral intention for using artificial intelligence (AI) and attitude toward it (ATAI) at higher education institutions is artificial intelligence learning. Artificial intelligence education is not widely available in Saudi Arabian universities. The study’s goal is to ascertain how perceptions of assessment quality, perceived risk, price value, artificial intelligence anxiety, educational quality, and perceived AI intelligence affect attitudes toward and perceived usefulness of employing artificial intelligence. When attempting to encourage the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in higher education, take into account factors such as perceived utility, attitude toward AI, behavioral intention to use, user happiness, and general mindset regarding AI. Additionally considered is the mediating function that behavioral intention and user pleasure have when utilizing artificial intelligence (USAI). A survey of Saudi universities was conducted in order to meet the study’s goal. 183 questionnaires were distributed around the universities to collect student data. Partial least squares (PLS) analysis and structural equation modeling were utilized to examine the data once it was gathered. User satisfaction in using artificial intelligence is the most crucial element in promoting student adoption of AI in higher education ( $\beta = 0.646$ , t-value = 10.402). Perceived usefulness of using artificial intelligence ( $\beta = 0.309$ , t-value = 4.240;  $\beta = 0.275$ , t-value = 2.194; and  $\beta = 0.473$ , t-value = 7.619, respectively) and attitude toward artificial intelligence ( $\beta = 0.285$ , t-value = 2.584; and  $\beta = 0.151$ , t-value = 2.453, respectively) are significant factors in transferring the positive effects of behavioral intention to use and user satisfaction in using artificial intelligence. A crucial part of communicating the positive impacts of AI adoption in higher education is also played by user satisfaction ( $\beta = 0.646$ , t-value = 10.402, respectively) and behavioral intention to use AI ( $\beta = 0.174$ , t-value = 2.817, respectively)”. We can better comprehend Saudi undergraduates’ motivation to use artificial intelligence (AI) for learning in higher education thanks to this study, which combines the TAM model and UTAUT theory. Future research in educational environments can make use of this theoretical framework. Furthermore, this study provides educators and educational institutions with some recommendations on how to motivate students to use AI to achieve better outcomes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3553631","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, through Researchers Supporting Project(grant numbers:RSP-2025/R417); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10937155","Artificial intelligence (AI);educational quality;artificial intelligence anxiety;perceived risk;TAM model;UTAUT theory","Artificial intelligence;Education;Learning (artificial intelligence);Chatbots;Training;Anxiety disorders;Reliability;Information technology;Art;Oral communication","","3","","126","CCBY","21 Mar 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This research examines the factors affecting the adoption of AI for collaboration among university students, with a focus on promoting inclusivity. Data was gathered from 443 students at King Faisal University using a survey designed to measure constructs related to AI adoption in collaborative learning. The questionnaire, based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), was tailored to the educational AI context. “Structural equation modeling (SEM)” and hypothesis testing were applied to evaluate the relationships between constructs. The results indicated that “perceived ease of use”, “perceived usefulness”, and “behavioral intention to use AI” are significant predictors of AI adoption among students. Additionally, trust and familiarity with AI were identified as key drivers of behavioral intention. However, the hypothesis that the perceived quality of AI output influences “perceived usefulness” was not supported, suggesting students may not strongly link the quality of AI outputs to its usefulness in academic contexts. This study adds to the body of literature by providing empirical insights into the factors influencing AI adoption for collaboration, offering practical recommendations for creating more inclusive and effective educational environments.

Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Support Theory (SST), the research examines perceived usefulness, ease of use, and support measures, including educational and emotional support. The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.160$ , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( $\beta = 0.140$ , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( $\beta = 0.670$ , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( $\beta = 0.330$ , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( $\beta = 0.760$ , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3534099","King Saud University, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia(grant numbers:RSP2025R159); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10852323","Artificial intelligence;social support theory;AI adoption frameworks;TAM;educational AI","Artificial intelligence;Education;Generative AI;Chatbots;Solid modeling;Technology acceptance model;Stakeholders;Security;Psychology;Numerical analysis","","16","","118","CCBY","24 Jan 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Mobile Learning (ML) has been used in the study as an educational social platform at both public and private higher-education institutes. The key hypotheses of this study are based on how COVID-19 has influenced the incorporation of mobile learning (ML) as the pandemic brings about an increase in different kinds of fear. The major kinds of fear that students and teachers/instructors are facing at this time include: fear because of complete lockdown, fear of experiencing education collapse and fear of having to give up social relationships. The proposed model was evaluated by developing a questionnaire survey which was distributed among 280 students at Zayed University, on the Abu Dhabi Campus, in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) with the purpose of collecting data from them. This study uses a new hybrid analysis approach that combines SEM and deep learning-based artificial neural networks (ANN). The importance-performance map analysis is also used in this study to determine the significance and performance of every factor. Both ANN and IPMA research showed that Attitude (ATD) are the most important predictor of intention to use mobile learning. According to the empirical findings, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, satisfaction, attitude, perceived behavioral control, and subjective norm played a strongly significant role justified the continuous Mobile Learning usage. It was found that perceived fear and expectation confirmation were significant factors in predicting intention to use mobile learning. Our study showed that the use of mobile learning (ML) in the field of education, amid the coronavirus pandemic, offered a potential outcome for teaching and learning; however, this impact may be reduced by the fear of losing friends, a stressful family environment and fear of future results in school. Therefore, during the pandemic, it is important to examine students appropriately so as to enable them to handle the situation emotionally. The proposed model has theoretically given enough details as to what influences the intention to use ML from the viewpoint of internet service variables on an individual basis. In practice, the findings would allow higher education decision formers and experts to decide which factors should be prioritized over others and plan their policies appropriately. This study examines the competence of the deep ANN model in deciding non-linear relationships among the variables in the theoretical model, methodologically.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097753","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9488198","Artificial Neural Network Architecture;hybrid-model;mobile learning;Structural Equation Modeling;subjective norm","Mathematical model;Artificial neural networks;Technology acceptance model;Education;COVID-19;Uncertainty;Pandemics","","85","","86","CCBY","16 Jul 2021","2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Instead, new and developing Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) are emerging as a promising paradigm for creating a profound change in digitizing education. It facilitates active learning with the enhancement in its delivery and how students grasp it by representing the shift from traditional desktop-as-a-platform towards the network-as-a-platform model. This paper proposes an extended Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) with ICT-based teaching and learning platform. TAM is the fundamental model to understand user perceptions and behavior towards potential acceptance or rejection of the technology. A mixed research methodology is adopted, comprising a series of survey questionnaires, evaluation of results, and the undergraduate student's performance in the collection of quantitative and qualitative data to measure the acceptance of the proposed research model. For the practical implication of the proposed research model, four groups of 300 students each or two programming courses: C++ and Java, were analyzed in two consecutive academic sessions in a controlled environment for lecture and laboratory classes. Series of statistical result analyses were performed and examined with hypothesized relationships to measure the desired outcome. It measures the impact on the following constructs: student interest, motivation, understanding, satisfaction, class attention and interaction, attendance, improve grades, and perception of pedagogical effect. Results show positive effects for identified research questions and hypotheses, helping students with the knowledge, understanding, and deep learning programming and debugging skills. The novelty of this research lies in extending the findings using real-time monitoring facilities to track student activities and progress, including frequency use and intention to use a technologically driven learning style.

Background: The rise of advanced AI exemplified by ChatGPT developed by OpenAI, has sparked interest in its application within higher education. AI has the potential to reshape education delivery through chatbots and related tools, improving remote learning and mitigating challenges, such as student isolation and educator administrative burdens. Yet, ChatGPT’s practical applications in education remain uncertain, potentially due to its novel and enigmatic nature. Additionally, current e-learning chatbot systems often suffer from development complexity and a lack of input from key stakeholders, leading to developer-focused solutions rather than user-centered ones.

This research examines the main variables affecting Chinese preservice teachers’ readiness to apply AI in higher education by using the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) framework. Structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze a questionnaire (N =493) that was distributed to preservice teachers in higher institution. The study finds that performance expectancy, habit, and ethical and privacy concerns significantly influence behavior intention, highlighting their importance in fostering AI adoption. Behavior intention is a strong predictor of use behavior, emphasizing the need to focus on behavior to ensure effective technology integration. Effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, or learning value do not significantly affect behavior intention, suggesting their impact may be context-specific.

Through a comprehensive questionnaire survey of 447 students, the research model is evaluated using the partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), a symmetric approach, and fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) as an asymmetric approach. The PLS-SEM results supported the positive role of performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and habit and the negative role of perceived threats in affecting chatbot use for knowledge sharing. Although PLS-SEM results revealed that social influence, facilitating conditions, and hedonic motivation have no impact on chatbot use, the fsQCA analysis revealed that all factors might play a role in shaping the use of chatbots.

The effectiveness of these tools varies based on their knowledge sources; assistants with localized domain-specific knowledge may have limitations, while tools, such as ChatGPT, using broad datasets, might offer recommendations that do not always match the specific objectives of a capstone course. Addressing a gap in current educational technology, this article introduces an AI Knowledge Assistant specifically designed to overcome the limitations of the existing tools by enhancing the quality and relevance of large language models (LLMs). It achieves this through the innovative integration of contextual knowledge from a local “lessons learned” database tailored to the capstone course. We conducted a study with 150 students using the assistant during their capstone course. Integrated into the Kanban project tracking system, the assistant offered recommendations using different strategies: direct searches in the lessons learned database, direct queries to a generative pretrained transformers (GPT) model, query enrichment with lessons learned before submission to GPT and large language model meta AI (LLaMa) models, and query enhancement with Stack Overflow data before GPT processing. Survey results underscored a strong preference among students for direct LLM queries and those enriched with local repository insights, highlighting the assistant's practical value. Furthermore, our linguistic analysis conclusively demonstrated that texts generated by the LLM closely mirrored the linguistic standards and topical relevance of university course requirements. This alignment not only fosters a deeper understanding of course content but also significantly enhances the material's applicability to real-world scenarios.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2024.3396735","National Center for Artificial Intelligence(grant numbers:FB210017); Chilean National Agency for Research and Development; ANID Scholarship Program DOCTORADO NACIONAL(grant numbers:2021-21212115); Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile; National Center for Artificial Intelligence(grant numbers:FB210017); Chilean National Agency for Research and Development; ANID Scholarship Program DOCTORADO NACIONAL(grant numbers:2021-21212115); Programa de Inserción Académica 2022, Vicerrectoría Académica y Prorrectoría; ANID Scholarship Program DOCTORADO NACIONAL(grant numbers:2024-21240734); Millennium Institute for Foundational Research on Data(grant numbers:ICN17_002); ANID Fondecyt(grant numbers:1241462); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10518103","Capstone courses;ChatGPT;context-aware learning;generative artificial intelligence (AI);large language models (LLMs);software engineering education","Software;Artificial intelligence;Task analysis;Software engineering;Codes;Chatbots;Knowledge engineering","","24","","39","IEEE","3 May 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This study explores the factors influencing L2 majors’ intention to use GenAI for learning, based on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Data were collected from 668 L2 majors at various Chinese universities through an online questionnaire with six validated scales. Structural equation modeling (SEM) via AMOS 24 revealed several key findings. First, demographic factors (gender and age) did not significantly affect the TPB constructs. Second, subjective norm and attitude positively influenced behavioral intention, while perceived behavioral control did not have a significant effect, contrary to TPB predictions. Additionally, GenAI literacy was found to be a positive predictor of behavioral intention, both directly and indirectly through attitude. External beliefs positively influenced subjective norm, perceived behavioral control, and attitude, which in turn impacted behavioral intention, with mediation effects observed through subjective norm and attitude. However, perceived behavioral control did not mediate the relationship between external beliefs and behavioral intention.

This research investigates the influence of knowledge management factors on the continuous usage of ChatGPT for educational purposes while concurrently evaluating student satisfaction with its use in learning. Using a quantitative approach, a structured questionnaire was administered to 513 Vietnamese university students via Google Forms for data collection. The partial least squares structural equation modeling statistical technique was employed to examine the relationships between identified factors and evaluate the research model. The results provided strong support for several hypotheses, revealing significant positive effects of expectation confirmation on perceived usefulness and satisfaction, as well as perceived usefulness on user satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT. These findings suggest that when students recognize the usefulness of ChatGPT for their learnings, they experience higher satisfaction and are more likely to continue using it. In addition, knowledge acquisition significantly impacts both satisfaction and continuous usage of ChatGPT, while knowledge sharing and application influence satisfaction exclusively. This indicates that students prioritize knowledge acquisition over sharing and applying knowledge through ChatGPT. The study has theoretical and practical implications for ChatGPT developers, educators, and future research.

However, college students have different online learning behaviors and attitudes toward artificial intelligence (AI) learning tools. In this paper, a portrait model is proposed for college students, which focuses on their online learning behavior and attitudes toward AI learning tools. Moreover, the proposed portrait model is built based on AI technology, i.e., random forest algorithm and long short-term memory (LSTM) algorithm are applied. In this model, there are three main parts: data pre-processing, building a multi-dimensional label system, and portrait model of college students. Firstly, the information collected through the questionnaire is quantified and its quality is improved by deleting invalid data. Then, a multi-dimensional label system is built for college students’ portraits, including basic attributes, online behavior attributes, behavioral attributes of using learning software, and psychological attributes of AI learning tools. Since each label consists of multiple indexes, the variance-based filtering method is used to streamline the indexes of online behavior attributes and behavioral attributes of using learning software, the random forest algorithm is applied to reduce the dimension of psychological attributes of AI learning tools. Next, the portrait of college students’ online learning behavior is realized by the K-means clustering algorithm, and the LSTM algorithm is performed to get the mapping mechanism between data and portrait categories. Through the mapping mechanism, the portrait of any new college student who is not included in the original dataset can be obtained quickly. Finally, the validity of the proposed model is verified by analyzing the questionnaire results of college students. Additionally, the portrait results provide a data basis for the development and popularization of AI learning tools.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3349448","Research on the Development Status and Strategies of School Music Education in Shenyang through the Background of Double Reduction(grant numbers:LJKQR20222472); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10379795","Artificial intelligence;college students’ online learning behavior;LSTM;multi-dimensional label system;portrait;random forest algorithm","Behavioral sciences;Indexes;Reliability;Clustering algorithms;Software algorithms;Random forests;Artificial intelligence;Electronic learning","","5","","29","CCBY","3 Jan 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

One of the greatest potentials of AI is to personalize higher education to the needs of students and offer timely feedback. This could benefit students with disabilities tremendously if their needs are also considered in the development of new AI educational technologies (EdTech). However, current reviews have failed to address the perspective of students with disabilities, which prompts ethical concerns. For instance, AI could treat people with disabilities as outliers in the data and end up discriminating against them. For that reason, this systematic literature review raises the following two questions: To what extent are ethical concerns considered in articles presenting AI applications assessing students (with disabilities) in higher education? What are the potential risks of using AI that assess students with disabilities in higher education? This scoping review highlights the lack of ethical reflection on AI technologies and an absence of discussion and inclusion of people with disabilities. Moreover, it identifies eight risks associated with the use of AI EdTech for students with disabilities. The review concludes with suggestions on how to mitigate these potential risks. Specifically, it advocates for increased attention to ethics within the field, the involvement of people with disabilities in research and development, as well as careful adoption of AI EdTech in higher education.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3365368","swissuniversities Project: P7—Accessible teaching in higher education; Swissuniversities Project: P8—Swiss digital skills academy: accessible open educational resources; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10433192","Artificial intelligence;disabilities;higher education;educational technologies (EdTech);ethics;risk assessment","Artificial intelligence;Education;Ethics;Bibliographies;Educational technology;Protocols;Privacy;Assistive technologies;Educational technology;Risk management","","29","","123","CCBY","12 Feb 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the current implementation of co-embodiment learning necessitates the real-time participation of instructors proficient in both virtual reality and co-embodiment, which poses challenges for its widespread adoption. To address this limitation, this study proposed a method for developing instructors trained on human motor data to effectively support motor skill learning through co-embodiment. The AI model was trained using supervised learning on data obtained from human motor learning sessions that employed co-embodiment. To evaluate the performance of the AI instructor, we compared the learning performance in co-embodiment learning with that of the AI instructor, recorded human instructor data, and a human instructor as well as in solo learning.

However, despite the growing adoption of VR in education, there remains a significant gap in research exploring how generative artificial intelligence (AI), such as generative pretrained transformer can further enhance these experiences by reducing cognitive load and improving learning outcomes. This study examines the impact of an AI-driven instructor assistant in VR classrooms on student engagement, cognitive load, knowledge retention, and performance. A total of 52 participants were divided into two groups experiencing a VR lesson on the bubble sort algorithm, one with only a prescripted virtual instructor (control group), and the other with the addition of an AI instructor assistant (experimental group). Statistical analysis of postlesson quizzes and cognitive load assessments was conducted using independent t-tests and analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the cognitive load being measured through a postexperiment questionnaire. The study results indicate that the experimental group reported significantly higher engagement compared to the control group.

This group requires comprehensive physical, mental, and functional care. Recent advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have significantly improved nursing capabilities by enabling real-time health monitoring, thus bolstering the early detection and prevention of severe health issues. Despite these advancements, the current systematic literature predominantly focuses on machine learning (ML) applications for a limited set of chronic diseases, often overlooking the extensive capabilities of deep learning (DL) technologies. Additionally, these reviews cover a narrow spectrum of studies, potentially needing broader insights and developments in the field. To address these shortcomings, our study conducts a systematic literature review of ML and DL applications in geriatric care for chronic disease management. We meticulously analyzed peer-reviewed articles published from 2014 to 2024, concentrating on AI technologies in elderly care. This review included 76 selected articles from leading publishers such as Elsevier, Springer, IEEE, MDPI, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, Nature, Cambridge University Press, Oxford University Press, and arXiv, which we categorized into three main groups: Neurological disorders (27 articles), Mental Health disorders (22 articles), and Physical/physiological disorders (27 articles). Our findings reveal that Random Forest, logistic regression, and convolutional neural network (CNN) are the most frequently used AI techniques, typically evaluated by accuracy metrics and the area under the curve (AUC). The findings indicate that although AI applications in geriatric care are promising, they require significant enhancements in technology and methodology to improve accuracy and reliability. Future research should focus on developing advanced AI tools, integrating cutting-edge deep learning models and comprehensive datasets to refine diagnostics and treatment protocols for chronic diseases in the elderly, ultimately enhancing patient outcomes.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3450970","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10654298","Nurse;older patients;chronic disease;artificial intelligence;machine learning;deep learning","Artificial intelligence;Diseases;Medical services;Older adults;Geriatrics;Medical diagnostic imaging;Machine learning;Artificial intelligence;Deep learning","","12","","211","CCBYNCND","28 Aug 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, little is understood about the attitudes of Chinese students toward this technology and the factors influencing their perspectives. This study employed a mixed-methods approach to comprehensively appraise Chinese students’ attitudes toward AI painting technology and the reasons behind these viewpoints. Data was collected from five universities and three high schools in China through questionnaire surveys and semi-structured interviews. Quantitative analysis demonstrated clear trends in students’ attitudes toward AI painting technology, with gender, educational level, and background in art and design identified as significant influencing factors. Specifically, students with higher levels of education demonstrated more favorable attitudes toward AI painting technology. This was evidenced by a strong positive correlation coefficient of 0.644 (p<0.01) between educational attainment and positive perceptions of this technology; whereas, a negative correlation with gender (coefficient of −0.263, p<0.01) indicated a difference in attitudes between male and female students, with males displaying more positive views. Specifically, background in art and design did not appear to significantly affect students’ attitudes, as presented by an insignificant correlation coefficient of −0.048 (p>0.05). In addition, regression analysis, with an R2 value of 0.419, suggests that these variables can account for 41.9% of the variance in student attitudes toward AI painting, emphasizing the significant effect of gender and education level on their perspectives. Qualitative findings further indicated that concerns about copyright ethics, job displacement anxieties, personal values and aesthetic viewpoints, and broader social and environmental implications all affected students’ attitudes toward AI painting technology. These findings offer valuable insights into the attitudes toward AI-generated technologies.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3412176","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10552736","AI art;AI painting;student attitudes;education and AI;mixed methods research","Artificial intelligence;Painting;Art;Surveys;Training;Interviews;Collaboration;Educational programs","","22","","83","CCBYNCND","11 Jun 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The majority viewed ChatGPT positively and suitable for learning programming concepts. However, its suitability for specific implementation tasks received mixed reviews. Students found it easy to adapt ChatGPT’s generated code to the exercises’ implementation tasks. The students primarily used it for acquiring background knowledge, learning syntax and programming concepts and suggesting suitable algorithms. Yet, some abstained from using it due to concerns to not garner sufficient programming proficiency, retrieving partially incorrect or misleading generated code, preferring an independent working style, or general skepticism about its benefits.

The analysis of 84 AI ethics guidelines worldwide provided the survey framework covering five ethical principles: transparency, fairness, privacy, nonmaleficence, and accountability. The overarching goal was to determine the commonalities and differences in the ethical concerns of Taiwanese laypersons toward AI. Participants aged from 20 to 70 ( $N =1$ ,200) completed a computer-assisted random-digit-dial telephone survey, which utilized ethical scenarios to capture social views, and item validity was confirmed using focus-group interviews. Results found that respondents concerned about nonmaleficence the most, emphasizing that AI applications should not harm humans. Taiwanese people therefore tended to support strict AI technology regulation. It was particularly interesting that different patterns of public concern emerged about accountability, with the opinions on attributing responsibility to stakeholders varying with scenarios and the public’s backgrounds. Those with higher education levels tended to attribute more responsibility to the industry, whereas those who had only received elementary-school education attributed accountability to AI developers. For self-driving cars, accountability was attributed to AI developers, whereas for medical decision-making, the accountability was attributed to the hospitals.

This study represents one of the first applications of SR in enhancing AI-driven cancer diagnostics. We compared eight common AI classification models (random forest, logistic regression, Naive Bayes, XGBoost, support vector machine, gradient boost, AdaBoost, and K-Nearest Neighbor) using performance metrics to evaluate their effectiveness in distinguishing cancer subtypes at varying noise levels. We trained our machine learning models using a dataset published by the University of California, Irvine’s Machine Learning Repository, which consists of 20,531 Ribonucleic Acid sequence gene expression features and 801 samples representing the five cancer subtypes. While previous studies on this dataset focused on feature selection, our study explores the controlled addition of synthetic Gaussian noise at five different levels through SR to uncover weak signals in the data. Furthermore, we selected 80 significant genes by evaluating the Analysis of Variance f-values and removing constant features. Our results indicate that models enhanced with SR can classify gene expression with high accuracy (93-98%) when noise levels are increased to  $\sigma =4$ . Logistic regression and support vector machine models performed the best in noise-free conditions. However, model accuracy decreased when noise levels exceeded  $\sigma =4$ , declining to 83-93% when  $\sigma =8$  across all models, showing machine learning vulnerability to unrestrained noise. The results of this study suggest that controlled noise implementation can enhance cancer diagnostic accuracy through SR.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3539309","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10876139","Classification;Gaussian noise;gene expression;feature selection;machine learning;stochastic resonance","Cancer;Boosting;Gene expression;Random forests;Data models;Machine learning;Accuracy;Prediction algorithms;Feature extraction;Classification algorithms","","1","","35","CCBY","5 Feb 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The model innovatively combines fully embedded feature engineering and high-low order parallel network structure, thus improving the recognition ability and evaluation accuracy of psychological characteristics. In order to verify the validity of the model, this paper uses three datasets: The national health and nutrition inspection survey in the United States, the national health and nutrition inspection survey in South Korea, and the behavioral risk factor monitoring system for testing and comparative experiments. The findings demonstrate that in three public datasets, the accuracy and F1 value of the FE-BiON model reach as high as 0.91 and 0.88, respectively, outperforming other comparator models and demonstrating greater prediction performance. The results of ablation experiment further prove that the synergistic effect of high-low order networks and the fully embedded feature processing method have played a significant role in capturing the complex relationship between features and improving the prediction performance of the model. The suggested FE-BiON model performs better in mental health prediction, as evidenced by its accuracy of over 90% in all mental health levels on the assessment of college students’ mental health.

It explores whether different dimensional factors in blended learning on the Rain Classroom platform are associated rules for English proficiency, while specifically focusing on their correlation with scores in the English proficiency test (CET-4, College English Test Band 4). The study identifies which association rules within these factors contribute to the improvement of students’ scores. Additionally, it classifies students based on their scores and learning effects using a decision tree structure. Based on the classification results, a multiple linear regression model is constructed to quantitatively assess the learning effects of using Rain Classroom for English language learning among students with different English proficiency levels. These analytical results enable educators, during the later stages of using Rain Classroom for blended learning, to adjust teaching decisions based on individual situations of students in different categories. They can design teaching materials and activities tailored to each student, leveraging the tool capabilities of Rain Classroom as an LMS and the advantages of blended learning. This approach aims to create more profound and meaningful learning experiences for students, assisting them in achieving educational goals and unlocking their full potential in academics.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3352169","Tianjin University of Commerce Teaching Program Funding Project titled The Digitization of Teaching Resources for College Foreign Languages—A Case Study of Microlecture Instruction(grant numbers:TJCUJG2023076); Innovative Application Research of Intelligent Listening Labs in University Foreign Language Teaching in the Context of Big Data(grant numbers:TJCUJG2023122); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10387696","Blended learning;learning management system (LMS);rain classroom;technology-mediated learning","Education;Hybrid learning;Rain;Learning management systems;Information technology;Electronic learning;Ecosystems","","11","","40","CCBYNCND","10 Jan 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the specific ways in which the appearance anthropomorphism of digital teachers influences the delivery of different knowledge types remain insufficiently understood. Drawing on Embodied Learning Theory and Parasocial Interaction Theory, this study investigates how digital teachers' appearance (cartoonish versus realistic) interacts with knowledge types (explicit versus tacit) to affect digital learning satisfaction and usage intention, exploring the mediating roles of physical and social presence. Initially, we implemented a 2 × 2 experimental design using a large language model application, collecting data from 475 participants to empirically test our hypotheses. Subsequently, in-depth interviews were conducted with 21 Chinese university students to further validate and clarify the underlying mechanisms behind these interactions. The results indicate that digital teachers with a cartoonish appearance are more effective for delivering explicit knowledge, whereas digital teachers with a realistic appearance excel in conveying tacit knowledge. Both physical presence and social presence were found to significantly mediate these effects. This research enriches our understanding of AI-enhanced online education by highlighting the alignment effect between digital teacher appearance and the type of knowledge delivered and by uncovering the underlying psychological mechanisms. In addition, it offers practical insights for the design of digital human appearances in educational interfaces and broader AI–human interaction scenarios.","1939-1382","","10.1109/TLT.2025.3560032","Provincial-Level Research Project on Teaching Reform in Higher Education Institutions of Jiangxi Province(grant numbers:JXJG-23-4-35); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:72232003); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10963735","Appearance anthropomorphism;digital teacher;explicit knowledge;physical presence;social presence;tacit knowledge","Education;Artificial intelligence;Digital humans;Anthropomorphism;Training;Streams;Data mining;Visualization;Electronic mail;Cognitive load","","2","","107","IEEE","11 Apr 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

While leaders are expected to have general leadership traits such as communication and resource management, leading teams in particular expertise areas requires additional skills specifically tailored to the tasks involved. For example, in information technology (IT), the roles of leaders are different from those in other non-IT fields due to the characteristics of IT projects. IT leaders, in particular, are required to have not just managerial and interpersonal skills but also necessary technical and practical capabilities. Understanding the key elements that contribute to the emergence and development of student leaders necessitates the ability to assess and recognize leadership in college students. However, current approaches for measuring leadership qualities entail administering questionnaires, which have coverage constraints and may mislabel future leaders if the survey is administered too early in a student’s educational phase, when their leadership talents may not have emerged yet. Addressing this problem, this paper introduces LAIGA, a machine learning-based framework for automatically and passively assessing and identifying leaders in college students from their academic profiles and behavior in the learning management system (LMS). The proposed technique can capture students’ actions that indicate general leadership qualities and technical competence, as evidenced by their academic performances. Specifically, we address two problems: leadership assessment and leader identification tasks. A case study of senior-year college students in the IT major is used to validate the proposed method, yielding 5.87% MAPE in the leadership assessment task and 83.2% F1 in the leadership identification task. Furthermore, the results also show that the proposed method can forecast leadership assessment and identification after graduation, knowing as little as students’ information during their first year of study. The findings of this study not only shed light on the ability to use machine learning technologies to automatically assess and identify leadership in college students but also allow educational organizations to understand factors that help develop leadership skills and design mechanisms that promote the growth of student leaders. The proposed method is highly generalizable to other fields of study as long as students’ grades and LMS activities are available.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3193935","Division of Academic Affairs, Mahidol University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9840357","Student leadership;assessment and identification;machine learning","Leadership;Task analysis;Machine learning;Predictive models;Education;Object recognition","","5","","64","CCBY","26 Jul 2022","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In our research, we propose a more efficient way to summarize students’ free responses from the Student Assessment of their Learning Gains (SALG) survey, a form of the SET survey, of an algebra-based introductory physics course at a large Canadian research university. Specifically, we use cluster and sentiment analysis methods such as K-means and Valence Aware Dictionary for sEntiment Reasoning (VADER) to summarize students’ free responses. For cluster analysis, we extract popular keywords and summaries of responses in different clusters that reflect students’ dominant opinions toward each aspect of the course. Notably, we obtain an average silhouette coefficient of 0.480. In addition, we analyze sentiments in students’ free responses that are determined through applying VADER. Intriguingly, we see that VADER (micro F1 = 0.57, macro F1 = 0.55) can better classify responses with positive (F1 = 0.62) and neutral sentiment (F1 = 0.59). However, evident disagreements arise with negative sentiment responses (F1 = 0.42). In addition, our research suggests that some Likert-scale summaries deviate from the sentiment of free response summaries due to the limitations of Likert-scale responses.

Previous researchers utilized biosignal data such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy and an electroencephalogram to reflect neural variation in factors related to learning ability. Additionally, machine learning algorithms have been used to identify the inherent associations between learning ability and related factors. Herein, we propose a classification framework for college scholastic ability test levels using unsupervised features extracted from a functional near-infrared spectroscopy signal dataset based on machine learning models. To extract unsupervised features from functional near-infrared spectroscopy signals, we constructed a one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder with an electroencephalogram dataset as a transfer learning approach. Eight handcrafted features (signal mean, slope, minimum, peak, skewness, kurtosis, variance, and standard deviation) with various window length conditions were calculated to compare influences on classification performance. Five evaluation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and area under the curve) were applied to evaluate the proposed framework’s performance. Among the five classification algorithms (XGBoost classifier, support vector classifier, naive Bayes classifier, decision tree classifier, and logistic regression), the XGBoost classifier was the best at classifying college scholastic ability test levels.

With the deployment of DL on various intelligent infrastructures featuring rich sensors and weak DL computing capabilities, a diverse range of AIoT applications has become possible. However, DL models are notoriously resource-intensive. Existing research strives to realize near-/realtime inference of AIoT live data and low-cost training using AIoT datasets on resource-scare infrastructures. Accordingly, the accuracy and responsiveness of DL models are bounded by resource availability. To this end, the algorithm-system co-design that jointly optimizes the resource-friendly DL models and model-adaptive system scheduling improves the runtime resource availability and thus pushes the performance boundary set by the standalone level. Unlike previous surveys on resource-friendly DL models or hand-crafted DL compilers/frameworks with partially fine-tuned components, this survey aims to provide a broader optimization space for more free resource-performance tradeoffs. The cross-level optimization landscape involves various granularity, including the DL model, computation graph, operator, memory schedule, and hardware instructor in both on-device and distributed paradigms. Furthermore, due to the dynamic nature of AIoT context, which includes heterogeneous hardware, agnostic sensing data, varying user-specified performance demands, and resource constraints, this survey explores the context-aware inter-/intra-device controllers for automatic cross-level adaptation. Additionally, we identify some potential directions for resource-efficient AIoT systems. By consolidating problems and techniques scattered over diverse levels, we aim to help readers understand their connections and stimulate further discussions.","1553-877X","","10.1109/COMST.2023.3319952","National Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholars(grant numbers:62025205); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62032020,62102317); CityU APRC(grant numbers:9610633); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10265028","Resource-efficient AIoT system;cross-level optimization;DL inference and training tasks","Artificial intelligence;Internet of Things;Computational modeling;Optimization;Training;Sensors;Surveys","","37","","368","IEEE","27 Sep 2023","Firstquarter 2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

It outlines how these advanced technologies have been integrated into an existing feedback-oriented platform to guide instructors in providing feedback inputs and establish a reference framework for future innovations in practical skills training for health professions education. Specifically, the proposed solution uses LLMs to automatically evaluate feedback inputs made by instructors based on predefined and literature-based quality criteria and generates actionable textual explanations for reformulation. In addition, if the instructor requires, the tool supports summary generation for large sets of text inputs to achieve better student reception and understanding. The case study describes how these features were integrated into the feedback-oriented platform, how their effectiveness was evaluated in a controlled setting with documented feedback inputs, and the results of its implementation with real users through cognitive walkthroughs. Initial results indicate that this innovative implementation holds great potential to enhance learning and performance in physiotherapy education and has the potential to expand to other health disciplines where the development of procedural skills is critical, offering a valuable tool to assess and improve feedback based on quality standards for effective feedback processes. The cognitive walkthroughs allowed us to determine participants' usability decisions in the face of these new features and to evaluate the perceived usefulness, how this would integrate into their workload, and their opinion regarding the potential for the future within this teaching strategy.

To overcome the imbalance problem arising from far different numerical proportion of sexual minority and majority members, we adopt the repeated random sub-sampling for training set by partitioning those who expressed heterosexual orientation into different number of splits and further combining each split with those who expressed sexual minority orientation. The prediction from 24-split random forest suggests that youths in Beijing with sexual minority orientation amount to 5.71%, almost two times that of the original estimation 3.03%.

The performance of students can be supported by the extra assignments and projects given by the instructors for students with low performance. However, a major problem is that students at-risk cannot be identified early. This situation is being investigated by various researchers using Machine Learning techniques. Machine learning is used in a variety of areas and has also begun to be used to identify students at-risk early and to provide support by instructors. This research paper discusses the performance results found using Machine learning algorithms to identify at-risk students and minimize student failure. The main purpose of this project is to create a hybrid model using the ensemble stacking method and to predict at-risk students using this model. We used machine learning algorithms such as Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, AdaBoost Classifier and Logistic Regression in this project. The performance of each machine learning algorithm presented in the project was measured with various metrics. Thus, the hybrid model by combining algorithms that give the best prediction results is presented in this study. The data set containing the demographic and academic information of the students was used to train and test the model. In addition, a web application developed for the effective use of the hybrid model and for obtaining prediction results is presented in the report. In the proposed method, it has been realized that stratified k-fold cross validation and hyperparameter optimization techniques increased the performance of the models. The hybrid ensemble model was tested with a combination of two different datasets to understand the importance of the data features. In first combination, the accuracy of the hybrid model was obtained as 94.8% by using both demographic and academic data. In the second combination, when only academic data was used, the accuracy of the hybrid model increased to 98.4%. This study focuses on predicting the performance of at-risk students early.

In this study, we design a customized role-based agent (CRBA), which can be configured for different roles specializing in specific areas of expertise, making the LLM yield content of higher specialization. An iterative architecture of multi-CRBAs is proposed to generate multistep projects, where CRBAs automatically criticize and optimize the LLM's intermediate outputs to enhance quality. We propose ten evaluation metrics across three aspects to assess project quality through expert grading. Further, we conduct an A/B test among 60 undergraduate students in a programming course and collect their feedback through a questionnaire. According to the students' rating results, the LLM-generated projects have comparable performance to man-made ones in terms of project description, learning step setting, assistance to students, and overall project quality.

MsaCNN adopts multi-scale convolution kernels on student grade records to capture structured features, a global attention strategy to discover the relationship between courses, and multiple input-heads to integrate multi-source features.

The study compares the predictive performance of long short-term memory (LSTM) networks, support vector regression and feed forward neural networks (FFNN) models for forecasting short-term solar irradiance. While all the models outperform principal component regression model, a benchmark model in this study, the FFNN yields the lowest mean absolute error and root mean square error on the testing set. Empirical results show that the FFNN model produces the most accurate forecasts based on mean absolute error and root mean square error. Forecast combination of machine learning models' forecasts is done using convex combination and quantile regression averaging (QRA). The predictive performance we found is statistically significant on the Diebold Mariano and Giacomini-White tests. Based on all the forecast accuracy measures used in this study including the statistical tests, QRA is found to be the best forecast combination method. QRA was also the best forecasting model compared with the stand-alone machine learning models. The median method for combining interval limits gives the best results on prediction interval widths analysis. This is the first application of LSTM on South African and African solar irradiance data to the best of our knowledge.

The risks of data attacks have increased, especially in the institutions sector, as the use of digital technologies become easier around the users. This paper investigates the awareness of social engineering attacks and cyber-security threats at the University of Sulaimani. The University of Sulaimani, based in the Kurdistan Region of Iraq, has a large number of students and staff; due to the increase of social engineering threats and lack of knowledge of cyber securities, the internet users at the University of Sulaimani put their confidential data at risk. This research has employed a quantitative approach, using a self-report questionnaire to gather primary data from participants. The online survey has been launched at the University of Sulaimani to provide a measurement of social engineering attacks on students and staff. The results show a variety of factors impacting participants’ awareness of their data.

Since there are no obvious symptoms during the early stages of CKD, patients often fail to notice the disease. Early detection of CKD enables patients to receive timely treatment to ameliorate the progression of this disease. Machine learning models can effectively aid clinicians achieve this goal due to their fast and accurate recognition performance. In this study, we propose a machine learning methodology for diagnosing CKD. The CKD data set was obtained from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository, which has a large number of missing values. KNN imputation was used to fill in the missing values, which selects several complete samples with the most similar measurements to process the missing data for each incomplete sample. Missing values are usually seen in real-life medical situations because patients may miss some measurements for various reasons. After effectively filling out the incomplete data set, six machine learning algorithms (logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, naive Bayes classifier and feed forward neural network) were used to establish models. Among these machine learning models, random forest achieved the best performance with 99.75% diagnosis accuracy. By analyzing the misjudgments generated by the established models, we proposed an integrated model that combines logistic regression and random forest by using perceptron, which could achieve an average accuracy of 99.83% after ten times of simulation. Hence, we speculated that this methodology could be applicable to more complicated clinical data for disease diagnosis.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2963053","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61801400,61703348); Central Universities(grant numbers:XDJK2018C021,JSPS KAKENHI,JP18F18392); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8945312","Chronic kidney disease;machine learning;KNN imputation;integrated model","Diseases;Machine learning;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Analytical models;Kidney;Neural networks","","252","","37","CCBY","30 Dec 2019","2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

First, the characteristics and applications of big data involving vast, diverse, and complex datasets are analyzed. Understanding their attributes and scope of application is essential. Subsequently, a comprehensive investigation into AI-driven learning mechanisms is conducted, culminating in the development of an AI random forest model (RFM) tailored for sustainable digital marketing. Subsequent to this, leveraging a real-world case study involving enterprise X, fundamental customer data is collected and subjected to meticulous analysis. The RFM model, ingeniously crafted in this study, is then deployed to prognosticate the anticipated count of prospective customers for said enterprise. The empirical findings spotlight a pronounced prevalence of university-affiliated individuals across diverse age cohorts. In terms of occupational distribution within the customer base, the categories of workers and educators emerge as dominant, constituting 41% and 31% of the demographic, respectively. Furthermore, the price distribution of patrons exhibits a skewed pattern, whereby the price bracket of 0–150 encompasses 17% of the population, whereas the range of 150–300 captures a notable 52%. These delineated price bands collectively constitute a substantial proportion, whereas the range exceeding 450 embodies a minority, accounting for less than 20%. Notably, the RFM model devised in this scholarly endeavor demonstrates a remarkable proficiency in accurately projecting forthcoming passenger volumes over a seven-day horizon, significantly surpassing the predictive capability of logistic regression.

This study focuses on detecting and analyzing stress-related posts in Reddit’s academic communities. Due to online education and remote work, these communities have become central for academic discussions and support. We classify text as stressed or not using natural language processing and machine learning classifiers, with Dreaddit as our training dataset containing labeled Reddit data. Next, we collect and analyze posts from various academic subreddits. We identified that the most effective individual feature for stress detection is the Bag of Words, paired with the Logistic Regression classifier, achieving a 77.78% accuracy rate and an F1 score of 0.79 on the pre-labeled DReaddit dataset. To validate our model’s applicability to detect stress in the specific context of academia, we conducted a supplementary experiment by manually annotating 100 posts from academic subreddits, achieving a 72% accuracy rate. Our key findings reveal that the overall stress level in academic texts is 29%.

Access to remote lab tools is possible by pairing simulators, emulators and actual equipment, located in various geographical locations. Under this premise, Education 4.0 defines a new learning framework aligned with the fourth industrial revolution digital requirements. These constitute smart sensors, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Robotics. In this context, University graduates need to prepare themselves with complex problem solving and interdisciplinary problems. To this end, contemporary Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) teaching practices should be present along the way. Digitally competent students need to learn from a modern and adjustable curriculum tailored to cover necessary skills related to Internet of Things (IoT). Therefore, the digitization of University campuses, including smart IoT, Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and Fifth Generation (5G) automation infrastructures is necessary. In this work, we carry out an extensive STEM oriented survey which highlights and categorizes all contemporary digital tools and technologies needed to support future graduates.

However, conducting a site survey to establish a fingerprint database is time-consuming and labor-intensive, hindering the fast deployment of fingerprint-based indoor positioning systems. This article presents a novel fingerprint reconstruction framework to reduce the site survey cost. The proposed MoDeFA is a semi-supervised deep learning framework that uses only a fraction of RSS data tagged with known locations to reconstruct the radio map. The resulting augmented fingerprints ensure the implementation of online fingerprint matching. First, we design a deep regression model to predict the RSS distribution from the perspectives of the multiple observational spots at surveyed locations. Next, we apply denoising to the initial radio map, a noisy representation of the ground truth, using the synthetic noise independent of the map errors without the need for ground-truth labels. Finally, we develop a noise-reduction model to compress the feature representation using unlabeled samples. Building on this, a model that combines multiscale self-attention and gated scale selection can enhance the prediction of a target’s position. We tested MoDeFA on four public and a private dataset collected from the School of Software Engineering Building at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.

To improve the detection performance, input features into an ML model should be investigated specifically. In the existing pulsar detection researches based on ML methods, there are mainly two kinds of feature designs: the empirical features and statistical features. Due to the combinational effects from multiple features, however, there exist some redundancies and even irrelevant components in the available features, which can reduce the accuracy of a pulsar detection model. Therefore, it is essential to select a subset of relevant features from a set of available candidate features and known as feature selection. In this work, two feature selection algorithms –Grid Search (GS) and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) – are proposed to improve the detection performance by removing the redundant and irrelevant features. The algorithms were evaluated on the Southern High Time Resolution University survey (HTRU-S) with five pulsar detection models. The experimental results verify the effectiveness and efficiency of our proposed feature selection algorithms. By the GS, a model with only two features reach a recall rate as high as 99 per cent and a false positive rate (FPR) as low as 0.65 per cent; by the RFE, another model with only three features achieves a recall rate of 99 per cent and an FPR of 0.16 per cent in pulsar candidates classification.

However, the adoption of e-learning in sectors such as engineering, science, and technology faces a particular challenge as it needs a special Laboratory Learning Management System (LLMS) capable of supporting online lab activities through virtual and controlled remote labs. One of the most challenging tasks in designing such LLMS is how to assess a student’s performance while an experiment is being conducted and how stuttering students can be automatically detected while experimenting and providing the appropriate assistance. For this, a generic technique based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) is proposed in this paper for assessing student performance while conducting online labs and implemented as a performance evaluation module in the LLMS. The performance evaluation module is designed to automatically detect the student performance during the experiment run time and triggers the LLMS virtual assistant service to provide struggling students with the appropriate help when they need it. Also, the proposed performance assessment technique is used during the lab exam sessions to support the automatic grading process conducted by the LLMS Auto-Grading Module. The proposed performance evaluation technique has been developed based on analyzing the student’s mouse dynamics to work generally with any type of simulation or control software used by virtual or remote controlled laboratories; without the need for special interfacing. The study has been applied to a novel dataset built by the course instructors and students simulating a circuit on TinkerCad. Using mouse dynamics fetching, the system extracts features and evaluates them to determine if the student has built the experiment steps in the right way or not. A comparison study has been developed between different Machine Learning (ML) models and a number of performance metrics are calculated.

Therefore, EDM is used to analyze students’ data gathered from various educational settings to predict students’ academic performance, which would help them to achieve better results in their future courses. The main goal of this paper is to explore the efficiency of deep learning in the field of EDM, especially in predicting students’ academic performance, to identify students at risk of failure. A dataset collected from a public 4-year university was used in this study to develop predictive models to predict students’ academic performance of upcoming courses given their grades in the previous courses of the first academic year using a deep neural network (DNN), decision tree, random forest, gradient boosting, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.

From the experimental results, it is observed that the proposed DNN model can predict students’ performance in a data structure course and can also identify students at risk of failure at an early stage of a semester with an accuracy of 89%, which is higher than models like decision tree, logistic regression, support vector classifier, and K-nearest neighbor.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3119596","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9568875","Deep neural networks;educational data mining;imbalanced dataset problem;machine learning;predicting students’ performance;resampling methods","Education;Data mining;Predictive models;Deep learning;Support vector machine classification;Random forests;Logistics","","136","","48","CCBY","13 Oct 2021","2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Analyzing runoff reduction parameters is crucial for effectively designing and implementing these systems. This study enhances traditional assessments using advanced sensors to gather meteorological and hydrological data from four green roof installations at University College Dublin (UCD) in Dublin, Ireland. The comprehensive dataset enabled detailed modeling of runoff hydrograph parameters using rainfall hyetographs, which were subsequently analyzed through sophisticated machine learning algorithms. This research introduces an innovative approach by identifying the optimal combination of variables for modeling key runoff characteristics, including Water Retention Amount (WRA), Total RUnoff Volume (TRUV), Peak Runoff Discharge (PRD), and Peak Flow Reduction (PFR). The findings are compelling, with Support Vector Regression (SVR) achieving R2 values ranging from 0.67 to 0.82 and RMSE values ranging from 0.37 to 1.51 millimeters for WRA, TRUV, PRD, and PFR. XGBoost (XGB) demonstrated superior performance, with R2 values ranging from 0.77 to 0.84 and RMSE values ranging from 0.28 to 1.26 millimeters for the same parameters. Random Forest Regression (RF) also showed robust results, with R2 values ranging from 0.76 to 0.84 and RMSE values ranging from 0.31 to 1.29 millimeters. Overall, the green roof system demonstrated a water retention rate of 55.69% for the studied events. The study identifies Cumulative Rainfall Volume (CRV) and Peak Rainfall Intensity (PRI) as crucial for modeling runoff, highlighting green roofs’ potential as sustainable urban infrastructure and offering key insights for their design and optimization.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3516313","pre-research project on Civil Aerospace Technologies(grant numbers:D010203); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:62271376); Guangdong Natural Science Fund for Distinguished Young Scholar(grant numbers:2023B1515020079); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10794760","Green roof;machine learning;rainfall hyetographs;rainfall-runoff modeling;runoff hydrograph;water retention","Green products;Rain;Air pollution;Meteorology;Urban areas;Sensors;Distance measurement;Temperature sensors;Green buildings;Wind speed","","1","","90","CCBY","12 Dec 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Specifically, this article measures and codes learners' engagement by fusing and compiling clickstreams (e.g., response time), physiological data (e.g., eye-tracking, electroencephalography, electrodermal activity), and survey data (e.g., goal-orientation) to determine what configurations of those data explain when learners can attain high or medium/low learning performance. For the evaluation of the approach, an empirical study with 32 undergraduates was conducted. The analysis revealed six configurations that explain learners' high performance and three that explain learners' medium/low performance, driven by engagement measures coming from the multimodal data. Since fsQCA explains the outcome of interest itself, rather than its variance, these findings advance our understanding on the combined effect of the multiple indicators of engagement on learners' performance.

As a result, there is an increasing trend to measure classroom attendance by employing various sensing technologies, among which pervasive WiFi infrastructure is seen as a low-cost method. In a dense campus environment, the number of connected WiFi users does not well estimate room occupancy since connection counts are polluted by adjoining rooms, outdoor walkways, and network load balancing. This paper develops machine learning-based models, including unsupervised clustering and a combination of classification and regression algorithms, to infer classroom occupancy from WiFi sensing infrastructure. Our contributions are three-fold: (1) We analyze metadata from a dense and dynamic wireless network comprising of thousands of access points (APs) to draw insights into coverage of APs, the behavior of WiFi-connected users, and challenges of estimating room occupancy; (2) We propose a method to automatically map APs to classrooms and evaluate K-means, Expectation-Maximization (EM-GMM) and Hierarchical Clustering (HC) algorithms; and (3) We model classroom occupancy and evaluate varying algorithms, namely Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), Linear Regression (LR) and Support Vector Regression (SVR).

As a result, countries have turned to microgrid developments. This article aims to study the feasibility of renewable sources such as solar PV and wind power for integrating a microgrid campus, taking the example of a case in East Africa, precisely the case of the University of Djibouti. We applied the weather parameters to evaluate the solar and wind potential with the Decision Tree method for analyzing and classifying the degrees of solar radiation and the consistency of wind speed. These data are spread over eight years to establish and capture seasonal changes and prove the accessibility of renewable sources in a specific site. The results were compared to Random Forest, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Naïve Bayes classifiers, which showed that the performance of classifying the Decision tree outperformed all other methods with an accuracy of 0.99321. The second work of this article explored the forecasting of the possible powers predicted with the LSTM deep learning method by the generation of the Solar PV array and wind turbines which were simulated on PVLib and Windpowerlib. The results are favorable, and the LSTM has performed well on the different hyperparameters. With the combination of machine learning and deep learning, it was possible to theoretically conclude the integration of renewable energies since we investigated all the potential possibilities in evaluating meteorological parameters and power predictions. Finally, decision scores from the Decision Tree architecture and the LSTM features were integrated to form a hybrid Tree-LSTM fusion method. It introduces a novel architectural concept that can effectively address sequential data and harness the non-linear capabilities of decision trees. The proposed model was validated by tuning the hyperparameters. Enhancing the maximum depth of the model increases the performance at a certain point, and conversely, reducing the minimum sample split improves the model performance. These contributions will help to create sustainable energy systems and increase the transition to a clean CO2 environment.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3328336","Africa Center of Excellence for Logistics and Transport (CEALT), University of Djibouti, Djibouti; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10299622","Decision tree;LSTM;microgrids;energy integration;feasibility;decision making","Microgrids;Renewable energy sources;Decision trees;Wind speed;Forecasting;Wind turbines;Wind power generation","","25","","96","CCBYNCND","30 Oct 2023","2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This means that their input to the algorithms must be numerical in order to solve classification or regression problems. Hence, it is necessary to encode these categorical variables into numerical values using encoding techniques. Categorical features are common and often of high cardinality. One-hot encoding in such circumstances leads to very high dimensional vector representations, raising memory and computability concerns for machine learning models. This paper proposes a deep-learned embedding technique for categorical features encoding on categorical datasets. Our technique is a distributed representation for categorical features where each category is mapped to a distinct vector, and the properties of the vector are learned while training a neural network. First, we create a data vocabulary that includes only categorical data, and then we use word tokenization to make each categorical data a single word. After that, feature learning is introduced to map all of the categorical data from the vocabulary to word vectors. Three different datasets provided by the University of California Irvine (UCI) are used for training. The experimental results show that the proposed deep-learned embedding technique for categorical data provides a higher F1 score of 89% than 71% of one-hot encoding, in the case of the Long short-term memory (LSTM) model. Moreover, the deep-learned embedding technique uses less memory and generates fewer features than one-hot encoding.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3104357","Institute for Information and Communication Technology Promotion (IITP) funded by Korea Government [Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning (MSIP)] (Development of the technology to automate the recommendations for big data analytic models that define data characteristics and problems)(grant numbers:2020-0-00107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9512057","Data preprocessing;categorical variables;natural language processing;machine learning","Encoding;Numerical models;Machine learning;Data models;Training;Biological neural networks;Computational modeling","","232","","40","CCBYNCND","12 Aug 2021","2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Our method overcomes these challenges by incorporating another, richer form of data collected from each student-lecture video-watching clickstreams-into the machine learning feature set, and using that to train a time series neural network that learns from both prior performance and clickstream data. Through evaluation on two MOOC datasets, we find that our algorithm outperforms a baseline of average past performance by more than 60% on average, and a lasso regression baseline by more than 15%. Moreover, the gains are higher when the student has answered fewer questions, underscoring their ability to provide instructors with early detection of struggling and/or advanced students. We also show that despite these gains, when taken alone, none of the behavioral features are particularly correlated with performance, emphasizing the need to consider their combined effect and nonlinear predictors. Finally, we discuss how course instructors can use these predictive learning analytics to stage student interventions.","1941-0484","","10.1109/JSTSP.2017.2700227","Zoomi, Inc.; NSF(grant numbers:CNS-1347234); ARO(grant numbers:W911 NF-14-1-0190); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=7917237","Clickstream data analysis;learning analytics;MOOC;student performance prediction","Videos;Predictive models;Prediction algorithms;Signal processing algorithms;Neural networks;Time series analysis;Electronic mail","","78","","34","IEEE","2 May 2017","Aug. 2017","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Previous studies indicate multiple causes of low female motivation in STEM degrees and careers, which inspired several initiatives to increase female interest in STEM. A proven way to captivate an audience to change its attitude is the heroic narrative model, a style of narrative in which a character goes through a sequence of difficulty-increasing and attitude-shaping quests. This paper proposes a heroic narrative model named Heroine’s Learning Journey (HLJ) targeted at counteracting low female participation in STEM courses. In particular, the HLJ model is developed especially for enhancing STEM online courses, by using a narrative that can encourage female students to engage and prevail in them. The HLJ model is divided into three acts, each composed of several stages symbolizing steps tailored to a female student’s development. The model was applied to set up the structure of a preexisting Machine Learning online course with hundreds of enrolled students. Although a first version of the course already presented a higher-than-expected female enrollment per se ( $\approx 37.3\%$ ), with HLJ, we verified an even higher female enrollment ( $\approx 59.2\%$ ), slightly surpassing male enrollments. The feedback provided in learners’ responses to a final, voluntary and anonymous questionnaire, allowed to obtain the degree of satisfaction of participants at the end of the course with the HLJ. The responses indicated that, at the end of the second edition of the online course, students were able to acknowledge the existence of a STEM gender imbalance, and appreciated the motivating nature of the HLJ model. From several student’s feedback and comments submitted in the questionnaire, one can conclude that the attitude-shaping character of the HLJ was greatly appreciated, in addition to the technical content of the course. All these preliminary results are indicative of the usability of HLJ to foster gender balance in STEM online courses. Thus, the present study contributes to STEM Education by leveraging the motivation of young women to enter and prevail in these areas of study.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3360376","Computaç ao de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior–Brasil (CAPES)(grant numbers:001); National Funds through Fundaçāo para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT)(grant numbers:SFRH/BD/143460/2019,UIDB/50021/2020); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10416858","Narrative;gender equality;motivation;STEM","STEM;Education;Engineering profession;Technological innovation;Mathematical models;Gender equity","","6","","127","CCBYNCND","30 Jan 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Despite the crucial role of engagement and emotions in shaping our reading experience, accurately tracking these dynamic states during actual reading remains a significant challenge. This study bridges this gap by detecting engagement and emotion levels during a reading task by leveraging the power of state-of-the-art deep learning models and investigating the correlations between the engagement levels and emotions. An experiment was conducted involving 18 university students reading 14 documents followed by a questionnaire to rate their levels of engagement, valence, and arousal after reading each document. A Tobii 4C eye-tracker with a pro license along with an Empatica E4 wristband were utilized to record behavioral and physiological data from the participants. A range of deep learning models were utilized for computing the engagement, valence, and arousal values, employing both user-independent and user-dependent methods. Our investigation revealed distinct yet complementary strengths in two deep learning models: Transformer excelled in user-independent detection of engagement and emotion with an accuracy of 80.38% (engagement), 71.28% (arousal) and 73.98% (valence) while ResNet shined in the user-dependent setting with an accuracy of 93.56% (engagement), 90.62% (arousal) and 88.70% (valence) which highlights the interplay between individual differences and reading dynamics. Intriguingly, we observed strong, document-specific correlations between engagement and emotion states, suggesting that different texts evoke unique affective responses. We developed an interactive dashboard visualizing predicted engagement and emotions, offering real-time feedback and personalized learning possibilities. The dashboard features an engagement gauge that displays the reader’s level of engagement based on predicted class probabilities, and an emotion emoji serving as a visual cue that illustrates the predicted emotional state of the reader. This technology can inform the design of dynamic interfaces that adjust to individual reading styles and emotional responses, potentially enhancing comprehension and involvement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3350745","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10382515","Digital reading;physiological sensing;eye tracking;deep learning;affective state","Physiology;Deep learning;Biomedical monitoring;Task analysis;Data models;Visualization;Data analysis;Digital systems;Sensor systems","","10","","67","CCBYNCND","8 Jan 2024","2024","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

We first propose three essential criteria that an ALR approach should consider in selecting the most useful unlabeled samples: informativeness, representativeness, and diversity, and compare four existing ALR approaches against them. We then propose a new ALR approach using passive sampling, which considers both the representativeness and the diversity in both the initialization and subsequent iterations. Remarkably, this approach can also be integrated with other existing ALR approaches in the literature to further improve the performance.

These surveys usually include both open-ended questions and Likert-type scale questions but the answers to open questions tend not to be analysed further than simply reading them. Recent research has shown that text mining and machine learning methods can be utilized to extract useful topics from masses of open student feedback. However, to our knowledge, not many off-the-shelf applications exist for processing open-ended student feedback automatically. Additionally, the use of text mining tools may not be available to all educators, as they require in-depth knowledge of text-mining, data analysis, or programming tools. To address this gap the current study presents a tool (Palaute) for analyzing written student feedback using topic modeling and emotion analysis. The utility of this tool is demonstrated with two real-life use cases: First, we analyze student feedback data collected from courses in a software engineering degree programme, and then feedback from all courses organized in a university. In our experiments, the analysis of open-ended feedback revealed that on certain software engineering course modules the workload is perceived as heavy, and on some programming courses the automatic code grader could be improved. The university-wide analysis produced indicators of good teaching quality, such as interesting courses, but also some concrete improvement points like the time given to complete course assignments. Therefore, the use of the tool resulted in actionable improvement points, which could not have been identified using only numeric feedback metrics.

ReAct! enables students to describe robots' actions and change in dynamic domains without first having to know about the syntactic and semantic details of the underlying formalism, and to solve planning problems using state-of-the-art reasoners without having to know about their input/output language or usage. In particular, ReAct! can be used to represent sophisticated dynamic domains that feature concurrency, indirect effects of actions, and state/transition constraints. ReAct! also allows the embedding of externally defined calculations (e.g., checking for collision-free continuous trajectories) into domain representations of hybrid domains that require a tight integration of (discrete) high-level reasoning with (continuous) geometric reasoning. ReAct! also allows students to solve planning problems that involve complex temporal goals. This broad applicability, and the intelligent interactive user interface, mean that students can work on interesting and challenging domains, ranging from service robotics to cognitive factories, leading to hands-on robotic applications. The efficacy of ReAct! was evaluated from three different points of view: 1) the course outcomes that demonstrate its utility in achieving the learning objectives of a research-oriented cognitive robotics course; 2) the user friendliness and usefulness of ReAct! for students, as evaluated by quantitative student surveys; and 3) instructors' experience of teaching the course either with or without ReAct!.","1557-9638","","10.1109/TE.2014.2318678","TUBITAK(grant numbers:111E116,113M422); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6807834","Artificial intelligence (AI) planning;automated reasoning;hybrid planning;knowledge representation;robotics","Planning;Cognition;Artificial intelligence;Education;Cognitive robotics;Educational robots","","19","","58","IEEE","29 Apr 2014","Feb. 2015","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, it presents a low-cost wireless sensor network (WSN) to collect the data and give the occupancy inference. We collect the environment data, with the presented WSN, in our university's laboratory. To verify the robustness of algorithms, we randomly insert anomalous sensor readings in the collected data through a Bernoulli distribution process. These anomalies represent different environment events or sensor failures. With these data, we evaluate the random forest (RF), classification and regression tree (Cart), and K-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithms. The best performing algorithms were RF and k-NN, presenting close to 99% of accuracy in data without anomalies and 97% in data with 10% of anomalies. However, we observe an average execution time of 2.34 s to k-NN against 25.65 s to RF. Thus, considering our evaluated scenarios, we elect the k-NN as the best algorithm to detect occupation in smart spaces.","2475-1472","","10.1109/LSENS.2021.3086962","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9447893","Sensor systems;machine learning;occupation detection;smart spaces;wireless sensor networks (WSNs)","Sensors;Temperature sensors;Wireless sensor networks;Radio frequency;Temperature measurement;Smart spaces;Machine learning algorithms","","1","","22","IEEE","7 Jun 2021","July 2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The objective is twofold: predicting at-risk DHH students and explaining risk factors. Merging ML and XAI, this approach could positively impact DHH students’ educational outcomes. A dataset of 454 records detailing DHH students is collected. To address dataset limitations, synthetic data and SMOTE are used. Students are categorized into three performance levels. The data is modeled with different ML models, transfer models, ensemble models, and combination models. Among the models, the stacked model with XGBoost, ExtraTrees, and Random Forest exhibited better performance with an accuracy of 92.99%. Results highlight the model’s significance, providing insights through XAI into crucial factors affecting academic performance, including communication mode, early intervention, schooling type, and family deafness history. LIME and SHAP values were found to be effective in deriving insights into DHH student performance prediction framework. Communication mode, notably, strongly influences at-risk students.

While many predictive models have been developed, their generalisability across different courses and learning contexts remains limited. This study explores whether clustering techniques can enhance the performance and adaptability of predictive models in educational data mining. Using the Open University Learning Analytics Dataset (OULAD), K-means clustering was applied to cluster courses based on behavioural, demographic, and academic features. Five machine learning models—logistic regression, random forest, neural networks, LightGBM, and support vector classifier—were trained both on the full dataset as a benchmark, and within each cluster. Cluster-based models consistently outperformed baseline models. The average AUC improved from 0.80 to 0.86 (+ 7.3%), and mean F1-scores increased from 0.66 (baseline) to 0.78 (best cluster-based model). The highest cluster-specific F1-score achieved was 0.88 using LightGBM. This improvement result from grouping courses with similar behavioural and demographic patterns, allowing models to learn context-specific risk factors more effectively. Clustering also uncovered distinct engagement profiles, such as consistently low activity, sporadic participation, and sustained high interaction, that enhanced model interpretability and allowed for more targeted identification of at-risk students. These findings highlight how segmenting courses by shared behavioural and demographic features can significantly improve both the performance and applicability of predictive models in diverse educational environments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3639083","National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)](grant numbers:RS-2023-00219107); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11271655","Clustering algorithms;educational data mining;K-means clustering;learning analytics;machine learning;predictive models;student performance prediction","Predictive models;Accuracy;Context modeling;Measurement;Data models;Data mining;Socioeconomics;Object recognition;Adaptation models;Performance metrics","","","","89","CCBY","1 Dec 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The conventional pipeline has certain potential limitations, which have not been sufficiently addressed and could be a bottleneck for the potential wide adoption of low-cost LiDAR–camera platforms. Different from the conventional pipeline, in this article, we propose the LiCaS3, the first deep-learning-based framework, for the LiDAR–camera synchronization task via self-supervised learning.

These quality assurance images are usually analyzed by a technician, but automated analysis has been proposed to reduce costs and improve repeatability. Reports on the automation of low-contrast detectability tests are scarce, and none can completely replace human work. In previous works, we have demonstrated that machine learning methods can be used to learn the subtleties of image quality and the visual assessment of technicians. We showed that machines are able to mimic human perception quite accurately. In these works, we used hand-designed image quality features. In the present work, we use a deep learning method to automatically design appropriate image features. By training this network on a large base with visual assessments from multiple technicians, we show that the machine can be taught to assess MRI image quality better than any technician alone, justifying its widespread adoption. Our dataset contained 12,000 binary responses to the detectability of low-contrast structures (“holes”). We used the median of the technicians’ responses as the gold standard. To increase statistical power, we repeated training and testing 5 times, using 5-fold cross-validation. We obtained a mean AUC (area under the ROC curve) of 0.983± 0.003. At the point of equal error rate, the mean accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were 93.2±0.7%, numbers higher than those achieved by any technician alone. Applying the obtained model to a completely independent test dataset with 10,800 structures, we obtained an AUC of 0.979. The predictions of our model in classifying spokes (sets of 3 holes) agree in 93.83% of the cases with the median of the responses of the technicians. These results again are better than the responses of any individual technician. We conclude that the ACR test can be performed by a machine with greater reliability than individual technicians.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3216838","Foundation for Research Support of the State of São Paulo (FAPESP)(grant numbers:2015/27022-0); National Council for Scientific and Technological Development (CNPq)(grant numbers:305377/2018-3); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9928173","Artificial intelligence;convolutional neural network;magnetic resonance imaging;machine learning;quality assurance;American College of Radiology","Magnetic resonance imaging;Artificial intelligence;Image resolution;Automation;Monitoring;Feature extraction;Convolutional neural networks;Machine learning;Radiology","","4","","19","CCBY","25 Oct 2022","2022","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, CD inherently faces two challenges: 1) varying sizes and shapes of change regions arising from spatial complexity; and 2) pseudo-changes caused by temporal migrations, such as seasonal variations and lighting differences. Existing methods typically focus on single-grained information during the feature interaction stage, which limits their ability to perceive changes in features of varying sizes. In addition, these methods inadequately address ambiguous regions during the difference capture stage, making them highly susceptible to pseudo-change interference. To address these challenges, we propose a novel network called the spatio-temporal multigranularity intermingling network (STMINet). First, we introduce the spatio-temporal multigranularity interleaving module to capture multigranularity information across both time and space, greatly enhancing the detection of changes in features of varying sizes and shapes. Second, we propose the multibranch differential acquisition, which incorporates information from inconspicuous regions and mitigates pseudo-change interference through a three-branch design. Experimental results on four publicly available datasets (learning, vision, and remote sensing-CD, Guangzhou dataset-CD, Wuhan university-CD, and Sun Yat-Sen university dataset-CD) demonstrate that STMINet significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods in performance metrics and visualization, achieving F1 score improvements of 0.22–3.42% over existing approaches while employing a simple ResNet-18 backbone.","2151-1535","","10.1109/JSTARS.2025.3607201","National Key Research and Development Program Project of China(grant numbers:2024YFC3306902); National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:U24A20242,62176237,61906168,62272267); Fundamental Research Funds for the Provincial Universities of Zhejiang(grant numbers:RF-A2024013); Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LY23F020023,LZ23F020001,LMS25F020003); Construction of Hubei Provincial Key Laboratory for Intelligent Visual Monitoring of Hydropower Projects(grant numbers:2022SDSJ01); Hangzhou AI major scientific and technological innovation project(grant numbers:2022AIZD0061); Joint Project of Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:LQZSZ25E050002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11153030","Multibranch differential acquisition (MDA);remote sensing change detection (RSCD);spatio-temporal multigranularity intermingling module (STMINet)","Feature extraction;Transformers;Semantics;Shape;Convolutional neural networks;Accuracy;Remote sensing;Interference;Graph neural networks;Visualization","","2","","48","CCBY","8 Sep 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Polysomnography, the standard diagnostic approach, faces challenges in accessibility and complexity, leading to underdiagnosis. To simplify OSA diagnosis, deep learning (DL) algorithms have been developed using cardiac signals, but they often lack interpretability. Our study introduces a novel interpretable DL approach (SleepECG-Net) for directly estimating OSA severity in at-risk children. A combination of convolutional and recurrent neural networks (CNN-RNN) was trained on overnight electrocardiogram (ECG) signals. Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping (Grad-CAM), an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) algorithm, was applied to explain model decisions and extract ECG patterns relevant to pediatric OSA. Accordingly, ECG signals from the semi-public Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial (CHAT, n = 1610) and Cleveland Family Study (CFS,n = 64), and the private University of Chicago (UofC, n = 981) databases were used. OSA diagnostic performance reached 4-class Cohen's Kappa of 0.410, 0.335, and 0.249 in CHAT, UofC, and CFS, respectively. The proposal demonstrated improved performance with increased severity along with heightened cardiovascular risk. XAI findings highlighted the detection of established ECG features linked to OSA, such as bradycardia-tachycardia events and delayed ECG patterns during apnea/hypopnea occurrences, focusing on clusters of events. Furthermore, Grad-CAM heatmaps identified potential ECG patterns indicating cardiovascular risk, such as P, T, and U waves, QT intervals, and QRS complex variations. Hence, SleepECG-Net approach may improve pediatric OSA diagnosis by also offering cardiac risk factor information, thereby increasing clinician confidence in automated systems, and promoting their effective adoption in clinical practice.","2168-2208","","10.1109/JBHI.2024.3495975","Ayudas para contratos predoctorales para la Formación de Doctores grant from the Ministerio de Ciencia; Innovación y Universidades(grant numbers:PRE2021-100792); University of Valladolid; Sara Borrell(grant numbers:CD23/00031); ISCIII cofounded; ‘Fondo Social Europeo Plus (FSE+)’; NIH(grant numbers:HL166617,AG061824); MCIN/AEI/10.13039/501100011033 and the European Union “NextGenerationEU”/PRTR; European Union through the Interreg VI-A Spain-Portugal Program(grant numbers:0043_NET4SLEEP_2_E); CIBER-Consorcio Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red(grant numbers:CB19/01/00012); Instituto de Salud Carlos III; European Regional Development Fund; project TinyHeart from 2022 Early Stage call; Childhood Adenotonsillectomy Trial; National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:HL083075,HL083129,UL1-RR-024134,UL1 RR024989); Cleveland Family Study; National Institutes of Health(grant numbers:HL46380,M01 RR00080-39,T32-HL07567,RO1-46380); National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute(grant numbers:R24 HL114473,75N92019R002); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10750335","Pediatric obstructive sleep apnea (OSA);deep learning (DL);eXplainable artificial intelligence (XAI);electrocardiogram (ECG);gradient-weighted class activation mapping (Grad-CAM)","Electrocardiography;Pediatrics;Sleep apnea;Databases;Recording;Convolutional neural networks;Explainable AI;Deep learning;Medical diagnostic imaging","Humans;Deep Learning;Electrocardiography;Child;Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted;Female;Male;Polysomnography;Child, Preschool;Sleep Apnea Syndromes;Sleep Apnea, Obstructive;Adolescent;Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted","6","","59","IEEE","11 Nov 2024","Feb. 2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The increased adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) in the ICU creates prospects for deep learning (DL) application systems in this discipline. However, monitoring and prediction systems in the ICU encounter problems with security, alarm errors, and interpretation. This research presents deep contrastive federated learning (Deep-CFL), an approach that leverages explainable AI (XAI), CFL, and imbalanced supervised learning techniques to address these problems. CFL introduces an innovative approach to minimize the difference in local and global model prediction ability while increasing the gap in prediction performance of the current local model and its previous model in a communication round. When paired with imbalanced learning, this strategy substantially mitigates error alarm problems while ensuring data security. The XAI technique, specifically integrated gradient, is employed to refine the DL-based model architecture to enhance system interpretability. Extensive experiments and in-depth analyses across three significant clinical datasets highlight the superior performance of Deep-CFL over local and centralized learning-based approaches.

Moreover, the optimal percentage of packets considered within a flow while extracting flow-level features is determined. Several experiments are conducted using naïve Bayes, support vector machine, k -nearest neighbor, random forest, and artificial neural networks on the University of Brescia (UNIBS) and the University of New Brunswick (UNB) datasets, which are both publicly available. The performed experiments show that 60% of flow packets are a good compromise that ensures high performance in the least processing time. The results of the conducted experiments indicate that random forest outperforms other algorithms achieving a maximum accuracy of 98.5% and an F-score of 0.932.

First, a novel rewiring rule by giving priority to long-distance cross-layer connections is proposed to increase the gradient transmission efficiency when constructing FFSWNN. Second, an improved ridge regression method is put forward to determine the initial weights with high activation for the sigmoidal neurons in FFSWNN. Finally, to further improve the learning efficiency, an asynchronous learning algorithm is designed to train FFSWNN, with the weights connected to the output layer updated by the ridge regression method and other weights by the gradient descent method. Several experiments are conducted on four benchmark datasets from the University of California Irvine (UCI) machine learning repository and two datasets from real-life problems to evaluate the performance of FFSWNN on nonlinear system modeling.

This model was designed to enhance anesthesia management efficiency and disease detection rates. In collaboration with the Department of Anesthesiology at Renji Hospital, which is affiliated with the Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, data pertaining to anesthesia were collected from 398 patients, who were undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. This yielded a total of 327 valid samples. Analysis of the patients’ basic information and physiological parameters during surgery revealed that body mass index (BMI) and age significantly impacted anesthesia management. Based on these findings, a multimodal deep learning model was developed that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, hyperparameter geometric manifold optimization (GMO) methods and data-driven sparse matrix classifiers. The model is capable of dynamically adjusting its parameters based on the specific needs of each individual patient, utilizing real-time physiological data to predict vital signs and anesthesia states with a 10-second lead time. In the experimental evaluations, the model demonstrated superior performance in drug usage prediction tasks. Compared with LSTM networks integrated with convolutional neural networks (CNN) and support vector machines (SVM), the LSTM model combined with GMO and sparse matrix classifiers, along with personalized physiological data, achieved a recall rate of 83% and an F1-score of 0.711 in drug usage prediction. The total computation time was maintained within 2.99 seconds, thereby satisfying the requisite for real-time applications. This model significantly improves prediction accuracy and stability over traditional methods, thereby enhancing operational efficiency in complex surgical environments.

A number of different algorithms and approaches are applied, including 2-D CNN, 3-D CNN, support vector machine (SVM), regression models, and other state-of-the-art deep learning models, although these methods do not show good performance for hyperspectral image classification. Furthermore, 3-D CNNs require a lot of computational power and are not mainly employed, whereas 2-D CNNs do not constitute multiresolution image processing and exclusively focus on spatial features. However, 3D–2D CNNs aim to incorporate spectral and spatial features, and their efficiency while being evaluated on various datasets tends to be limited. Moreover, a number of deep learning models have been proposed recently, but their performance is still limited. In order to solve these problems, in this article, we propose a novel deep hyperspectral shot, a deep smooth wavelet CNN shots ensemble for hyperspectral image classification. A deep smooth wavelet CNN utilizes layers of wavelet transform to extract spectral features. The computation of a wavelet transform is less intensive as compared to the computation of a 3-D CNN. After that, the extracted spectral features are integrated into 2-D CNN, which generates spatial features, as a result, generates a spatial–spectral feature vector for classification. Furthermore, we introduce the snapshots generation method and employ a cyclic annealing schedule to converge to several local minima along its optimization path and save the models. We build several snapshots of the deep hyperspectral shots model to enhance the performance of our proposed method. We propose the snapshots optimization and ensemble selection approach in order to solve the optimization problem within ensemble creation and further enhance the performance. In addition, we also introduce a novel activation function called Relish to increase spatial–spectral feature propagation and advance for smoother gradients. Overall, we ensemble the snapshots of our proposed method and achieved that can classify multiresolution HSI data with high accuracy.

Recent popularity of IoT and machine learning techniques could provide enabling technologies for collecting real-time big data and analyzing them for more accurate prediction of allergic disease risks for evidence-based intervention, but the effort is still in its infancy. This pilot study explored and evaluated the feasibility of a deep learning algorithm for predicting asthma risk. It is based on peak expiratory flow rates (PEFR) of 14 pediatric asthma patients visiting the Korea University Medical Center and indoor particulate matter PM10 and PM2.5 concentration data collected at their residence every 10 minutes using a PM monitoring device with a low-cost sensor between September 1, 2017 and August 31, 2018. We interpolated the PEFR results collected twice a day for each patient throughout the day so that it can be matched to the PM and other weather data. The PEFR results were classified into three categories such as `Green' (normal), `Yellow' (mild to moderate exacerbation) and `Red' (severe exacerbation) with reference to their best peak flow value. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model was trained using the first 10 months of the linked data and predicted asthma risk categories for the next 2 months during the study period. LSTM model is found to predict the asthma risk categories better than multinomial logistic (MNL) regression as it incorporates the cumulative effects of PM concentrations over time. Upon successful modifications of the algorithm based on a larger sample, this approach could potentially play a groundbreaking role for the scientific data-driven medical decision making.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2960551","Environmental Health Action Program (Development of Receptor-Based Environment-Induced Diseases Prevention and Management System Using Real-Time Collected Environment and Health Information)(grant numbers:2018001350005); Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention(grant numbers:2016ER670300); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8936445","Asthma;indoor particulate matter;deep learning;peak expiratory flow rates;real-time monitoring","Respiratory system;Real-time systems;Monitoring;Deep learning;Predictive models;Air pollution;Atmospheric measurements","","44","","40","CCBY","18 Dec 2019","2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Many of these decision making systems use machine learning methods that fit complex models to massive datasets. The successful deployment of machine learning (ML) methods to many (critical) application domains crucially depends on its explainability. Indeed, humans have a strong desire to get explanations that resolve the uncertainty about experienced phenomena like the predictions and decisions obtained from ML methods. Explainable ML is challenging since explanations must be tailored (personalized) to individual users with varying backgrounds. Some users might have received university-level education in ML, while other users might have no formal training in linear algebra. Linear regression with few features might be perfectly interpretable for the first group but might be considered a black-box by the latter. We propose a simple probabilistic model for the predictions and user knowledge. This model allows to study explainable ML using information theory.

To settle the above challenges, a novel HAR framework for multidimensional feature extraction and fusion based on aggregation and temporal adaptation (MFEF-ATA) is proposed in this article. To construct the framework, initially, an aggregation transformation-based dual path module (ATDPM) is developed.

Meanwhile, we construct a smart home activity (SHA) dataset to enrich the HAR sensor datasets from different application scenarios. The evaluation experiments of the MFEF-ATA framework are carried out on the wireless sensor data mining (WISDM) dataset, the University of California, Irvine HAR (UCI-HAR) dataset, and the SHA dataset.

However, research focusing on such predictions is scarce. Moreover, studies involving different types of predictors and comparisons between the predictive performance of various methods are virtually nonexistent.

The results show that models with objective predictors consistently outperform models with subjective predictors, and a combination of both variable types performs slightly better with an accuracy of 70%. For each of these three options, a different approach prevailed (gradient boosting machines for the subjective, Bayesian multilevel models for the objective, and Random Forest for the combined predictors).

The proposed approach incorporates a dynamic temporal segmentation method with a 10-day cycle, in conjunction with a long short-term memory (LSTM) network, to extract fine-grained behavioral sequence features. The experimental results demonstrate that the validation based on the XuetangX dataset indicates that ERGCN exhibits a remarkable predictive effect on the dropout of MOOC students in higher education, with an F1 value of  $92.56\pm 0.04$ % and an AUC value of  $88.84\pm 0.03$ %. In comparison with the conventional benchmark model (logistic regression and support vector machine), the absolute enhancement of the AUC is 10.31-19.33 percentage points, and the relative enhancement is 13.1% −27.8%. The study employs an explainability module to identify the key factors influencing student dropout. The study provides MOOC platforms with a prediction tool that combines high accuracy and transparency. This facilitates the implementation of customized intervention strategies by educators for students who are at risk.

Upgrade of production processes towards this Industry 4.0 model is one of the critical challenges for the industrial sector and, consequently, the training of students and professionals has to address these new demands. To carry out this task, it is essential to develop educational tools that allow students to interact with real equipment that implements, in an integrated way, new enabling technologies, such as connectivity with standard protocols, storage and data processing in the cloud, machine learning, digital twins and industrial cybersecurity measures. For that reason, in this work, we present an educational environment on Industry 4.0 that incorporates these technologies reproducing realistic industrial conditions. This environment includes cutting-edge industrial control system technologies, such as an industrial firewall and a virtual private network (VPN) to strengthen cybersecurity, an Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) gateway to transfer process information to the cloud, where it can be stored and analyzed, and a digital twin that virtually reproduces the system. A set of hands-on tasks for an introductory automation course have been proposed, so that students acquire a practical understanding of the enabling technologies of Industry 4.0 and of its function in a real automation.

It gained popularity recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic restrictions in 2020. However, to provide learners with appropriate educational materials in such a mobile environment, the characteristics and context of the learners must be considered. Therefore, in this paper, we propose a framework for providing an adaptive context-aware learning process considering a combination of student learning models and principles of Universal Design for Learning (UDL). The proposed system consists of components capable of detecting changes in context and adapting the way the application responds and behaves. The framework uses a machine-learning algorithm to predict learners' characteristics and follow UDL principles to deliver enriched user experience and location-aware content and activities. An online survey was conducted with 20 undergraduate students. We analyzed their levels of satisfaction with the proposed m-learning system. From the analyzed data, we noticed that the average rating values are close to 4.5, which indicates that the proposed m-learning system complies with UDL principles and provides an adaptive and localized learning environment, thus enhancing the efficiency of the learning process and experiences. The study also investigated the impact of factors (i.e., noise level, physical activity, and location) on learners' concentration towards the learning process. The results show that these factors have a significant impact on the learner's concentration level.","1550-4654","","10.13052/jmm1550-4646.1934","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10976609","m-learning;mobile learning;e-learning;electronic learning;UDL;universal design for learning;adaptive learning;context awareness;ubiquitous learning;mobile cloud computing;personalized learning;machine learning","Surveys;Cloud computing;Pandemics;Machine learning;Multimedia computing;Prediction algorithms;Mobile learning;User experience;Noise level;Context modeling","","","","28","","25 Apr 2025","May 2023","","River Publishers","River Publishers Journals"

Fast, reliable, and easily accessible clinical assessment of the severity of the disease can help in allocating and prioritizing resources to reduce mortality. The objective of the study was to develop and validate an early scoring tool to stratify the risk of death using readily available complete blood count (CBC) biomarkers. A retrospective study was conducted on twenty-three CBC blood biomarkers for predicting disease mortality for 375 COVID-19 patients admitted to Tongji Hospital, China from January 10 to February 18, 2020. Machine learning based key biomarkers among the CBC parameters as the mortality predictors were identified. A multivariate logistic regression-based nomogram and a scoring system was developed to categorize the patients in three risk groups (low, moderate, and high) for predicting the mortality risk among COVID-19 patients. Lymphocyte count, neutrophils count, age, white blood cell count, monocytes (%), platelet count, red blood cell distribution width parameters collected at hospital admission were selected as important biomarkers for death prediction using random forest feature selection technique. A CBC score was devised for calculating the death probability of the patients and was used to categorize the patients into three sub-risk groups: low (<=5%), moderate (>5% and <=50%), and high (>50%), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) of the model for the development and internal validation cohort were 0.961 and 0.88, respectively. The proposed model was further validated with an external cohort of 103 patients of Dhaka Medical College, Bangladesh, which exhibits in an AUC of 0.963.

Prognostic and Health Management Systems (PHMS) can assist both operators and managers of Smart Buildings, anticipating potential problems that can reduce the energy efficiency of the building. However, PHMS usually lack the capability of predicting changes on Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) related to energy consumption. Therefore, having a reliable method to predict the energy demand of a building’s HVAC system is an important complement to a building’s PHMS. This paper proposes a data-driven methodology to create predictive models of energy demand taking into account the effect of weather conditions on energy consumption. The methodology consists of two stages. The first considers the environmental variables affecting the building to identify clusters with similar conditions. For the second stage, Deep Learning Long-short Term Memory (LSTM) models in an encoder-decoder architecture were used. Our proposal is to build two different types of models, named reference cluster and recent models, both being able to predict the total heating demand of a smart building in the short and medium term, one day and one week in advance. The reference cluster model is built with historical data from the distant past for each cluster. The recent model is built with historical data from the immediate past. In this paper we have applied this methodology to a smart educational building: the Alice Perry School of Engineering at the National University of Ireland in Galway. This case study illustrates the methodology and successfully tests its feasibility. Both reference cluster and recent models provide predictions achieving the acceptance criteria in this domain.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3331329","Spanish Ministerio de Ciencia e Innovacion(grant numbers:PID2021-126659OB-I00); University of Galway CoEI Postgraduate Scholarship 2018; European Commission through the SPHERE Project(grant numbers:820805); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10319387","Clustering;energy consumption forecast;HVAC systems;LSTM encoder-decoder;smart buildings;time-series forecast","Predictive models;Energy consumption;Smart buildings;Meteorology;Data models;Prognostics and health management;Atmospheric modeling;Clustering methods;Weather forecasting;Time series analysis;Long short term memory","","8","","37","CCBYNCND","15 Nov 2023","2023","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, the single life style cannot be maintained if they have dementia. Thus, the early detection of dementia is crucial. Systems with wearable devices or cameras are not preferred choice for the long-term monitoring. Main intention of this paper is to propose deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) classifier for indoor travel patterns of elderly people living alone using open data set collected by device-free non-privacy invasive binary (passive infrared) sensor data. Travel patterns are classified as direct, pacing, lapping, or random according to Martino-Saltzman (MS) model. MS travel pattern is highly related with person's cognitive state, and thus can be used to detect early stage of dementia. We have utilized an open data set that was presented by Center for Advanced Studies in Adaptive Systems project, Washington State University. The data set was collected by monitoring a cognitively normal elderly person by wireless passive infrared sensors for 21 months. First, 117 320 travel episodes are extracted from the data set and classified by MS travel pattern classifier algorithm for the ground truth. Later, 12 000 episodes (3000 for each pattern) were randomly selected from the total episodes to compose training and testing data set. Finally, DCNN performance was compared with seven other classical machine-learning classifiers. The random forest and DCNN yielded the best classification accuracies of 94.48% and 97.84%, respectively. Thus, the proposed DCNN classifier can be used to infer dementia through travel pattern matching.","1558-1748","","10.1109/JSEN.2017.2771287","Ministry of Science and Technology of Taiwan(grant numbers:MOST 106-2218-E-027-017,MOST 106-2221-E-027-137); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8101507","Non-privacy invasive;deep learning;device-free;assistive technology;smart house;travel pattern;elder care","Sensors;Lapping;Senior citizens;Dementia;Training;Monitoring;Biomedical monitoring","","31","","33","IEEE","9 Nov 2017","1 Jan.1, 2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Genetic Algorithm generates demand response strategies and optimizes battery dispatch, while LightGBM forecasts solar power generation and building load consumption. The approach aims to minimize operational costs and ensure microgrid sustainability, using a battery degradation cost function to extend its lifespan. Simulation results conducted in the University of Moratuwa microgrid show a significant 14.22% decrease in electricity costs under Sri Lanka’s current tariff structure, attributed to intelligent energy dispatch scheduling.

The two popular levers to achieve this goal include increasing the proportion of clean energy in the energy mix and enhancing energy efficiency. The former involves reducing reliance on fossil fuel-based energy sources and increasing the adoption of renewable energy. The latter involves understanding factors that impact the current energy footprint and improving the efficiencies of the process. University campuses comprise many buildings, and it is well-known that buildings have a sizeable energy footprint. Therefore, it is beneficial to understand their energy consumption and identify ways in which this could be further optimised. Furthermore, catering to the energy demand requires appropriate provisioning with significant costs associated with energy procurement on-demand. To address this, it is vital to predict demand in advance accurately. In this article, we elaborate on these two aspects, i.e., analysis of energy consumption and demand forecasting using deep learning-based time series techniques such as Long short-term memory (LSTM), Bi-directional Long short-term memory (BiLSTM), Gated recurrent unit (GRU), and Bidirectional Gated recurrent units (BiGRU). We analyse the different parameter optimisers and history window lengths to select a better hyper-parameter set for accurate energy use and demand prediction. Findings from this study show that the prediction follows the actual demand curve with a minimum RMSE of 65.354 MWh and 65.936 MWh for window sizes of four and six for validation (testing), respectively. The window size six performs better for most time-series algorithms and hyperparameter combinations.","2644-1268","","10.1109/OJCS.2024.3520198","UAE University(grant numbers:12R155); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10807248","Energy efficiency;demand prediction;sustainability","Buildings;Energy consumption;Logic gates;Deep learning;Forecasting;Computer architecture;Microprocessors;Computational modeling;Accuracy;Training","","","","19","CCBY","19 Dec 2024","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Named ARANAC (which stands for Application Risk Assessment based Network Access Control), this methodology is specially tailored for scenarios using the Bring-Your-Own-Device (BYOD) policy, where the adoption of some solutions can lead to problems in security and privacy for both the employees and the business organization. ARANAC mainly relies on the analysis of an aggregate of permissions declared in the manifests of installed applications on users' devices. The access control scheme combines three operational modules: i) a device monitoring tool, ii) a novel permission-based risk model, and iii) an anomaly-based detection machine learning module based on a methodology (called MSNM, from Multivariate Statistical Network Monitoring) that provides both detection and diagnostic capabilities. ARANAC's novelty is in the combination of four features. Firstly, it is privacy-aware, and thus, it does not require detailed information about installed applications but only an aggregate of permissions. Secondly, it builds a normality model by combining expert knowledge with data, capturing the behavior of a complete population of mobile devices. Thirdly, it is dynamic, as permissions are updated in real time, allowing the network to re-assess access control on a continuous basis. Finally, its diagnostic capabilities allow for giving recommendations to final users so that they are capable of mitigating their risks when accessing networks. We evaluated the approach with more than 80 Android devices at a university campus network and obtained interesting results regarding security risks in the usual deployment of device apps.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3097152","Spanish Government-Ministerio de Economía y Competitividad (MINECO); European Regional Development Fund (ERDF)(grant numbers:TIN2017-83494-R); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9483931","Android permissions;bring-your-own-device;mobile security;network access control;risk assessment","Access control;Monitoring;Smart phones;Proposals;Tools;Risk management;Mobile security","","7","","72","CCBY","14 Jul 2021","2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, most existing deep-learning-based face sketch synthesis models stacked only by multiple convolutional layers without structured regression often lose the common facial structures, limiting their flexibility in a wide range of practical applications, including intelligent security and digital entertainment. In this article, we introduce a neural network to a probabilistic graphical model and propose a novel face sketch synthesis framework based on the neural probabilistic graphical model (NPGM) composed of a specific structure and a common structure. In the specific structure, we investigate a neural network for mapping the direct relationship between training photos and sketches, yielding the specific information and characteristic features of a test photo. In the common structure, the fidelity between the sketch pixels generated by the specific structure and their candidates selected from the training data are considered, ensuring the preservation of the common facial structure. Experimental results on the Chinese University of Hong Kong face sketch database demonstrate, both qualitatively and quantitatively, that the proposed NPGM-based face sketch synthesis approach can more effectively capture specific features and recover common structures compared with the state-of-the-art methods.

Therefore, the structure of the network can be modified. In addition, the method can select automatically hidden layer feature without loss of the network prediction accuracy and increase the computation speed. Experiments on University of California-Irvine (UCI) data sets and BDA for battle damage data demonstrate that the method outperforms other reference data-driven methods. The following results can be found from this paper. First, the improved KL-SAE regression network can guarantee the prediction accuracy and increase the speed of training networks and prediction. Second, the proposed network can select automatically hidden layer effective feature and modify the structure of the network by optimizing the nodes number of the hidden layer.","2095-9230","","10.1631/FITEE.1601395","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11289777","Battle damage assessment;Improved Kullback-Leibler divergence sparse autoencoder;Structural optimization;Feature selection;E917","Deep learning;Training;Accuracy;Autoencoders;Predictive models;Feature extraction;Prediction algorithms;Data models;Root mean square;Optimization","","","","22","","16 Dec 2025","December 2017","","ZUP","ZUP Journals"

However, due to the large variability and complexity in progress of PD and the difficulties in gathering a single time-point measurement of a single sign, the goal of precision treatment and assessment severity would be impossible to achieve. Hence, the repeated monitoring and tracking of individuals during their daily living activities at different times would also be of great importance for treating this chronic disease. We propose a deep multi-layer perceptron (DMLP) classifier for behavior analysis to estimate the progression of PD using smartphones. This paper aims to identify severity in PD patients' actions by analyzing their speech and movement patterns, as measured with a smartphone accelerometer in their pocket at different times of the day. Popular machine learning classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, random forests, k-nearest neighbors, M5P, and DMLP, are applied on one dataset from the University of California Irvine and another dataset collected by the authors to classify each patient as being Parkinson positive or negative. We further measure the success of each method for their ability to correctly classify the patients into one of these categories. Of the experimental models, it is demonstrated that DMLP performs the best in both datasets.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2018.2851382","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61702553); MOE (Ministry of Education in China) Project of Humanities and Social Sciences(grant numbers:17YJCZH252); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8405749","Parkinson’s disease;behavior analysis;DMLP;classification","Smart phones;Diseases;Legged locomotion;Monitoring;Biomedical measurement;Sensors;Accelerometers","","115","","47","OAPA","6 Jul 2018","2018","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Academic libraries are a great source of information and knowledge to provide a wide range of services to meet end-user requirements. Due to the rapid changes in the educational environment and availability of huge library rental book data, it is required to utilize data mining and machine learning techniques in the context of the academic library to extract and analyze underlying knowledge from rental book data, which is important to facilitate library administration to drive better future decisions to improve and manage library resources effectively. These are the following resources, such as managing future demands of the library books, selection and arrangement of the books, operational efficiency, and also improve the quality of interaction between the library and end-users, etc. This work uses and analyzes a real dataset collected from the library of Jeju National University, the Republic of Korea. The dataset contains 2,211,413 rental book records including 173671 unique book records, 57203 unique number of the rental user, and 78 data parameters. In this paper, we propose a novel model to analyze and predict library rental book data to facilitates library administration in order to plan and manage library resources effectively and provide better services to end-users. The proposed model consists of two different modules; library data analysis and prediction modules. Firstly, we use data mining techniques to analyze and extract useful underlying patterns from library rental book data, which can lead to plan and manage library resources effectively. Secondly, a novel prediction model is proposed based on Deep Neural Network (DNN), Support Vector Regressor (SVR), and Random Forest (RF) to predict future usage of the academic libraries rental books. The performance results of the implemented regression models are evaluated in terms of MAE, MSE, and RMSE. In this paper, it is found that the DNN model performs significantly better than SVR and RF. The experimentation results show that the proposed model improves the future usage of library books to facilitate library administration to plan and manage library resources effectively. Based on the proposed model results, the academic library administration can easily plan and manage resources effectively to provide quality services to end-users.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.2990765","Energy Cloud R&D Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF); Ministry of Science, ICT(grant numbers:2019M3F2A1073387); Institute for Information & Communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP); Korean Government (MSIT) (AutoMaTa: Autonomous Management framework based on artificial intelligent Technology for adaptive and disposable IoT)(grant numbers:2019-0-01456); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9079499","Data mining;academic libraries;big data;machine learning;predictive analysis","Libraries;Data mining;Data models;Predictive models;Analytical models;Predictive analytics;Machine learning","","46","","54","CCBY","27 Apr 2020","2020","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The EEM model is assembled by using the prepared base models through a technique called “bagging.” In the experiment, a dataset of 289 Chinese patients, which was provided by the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, is used for training, validation, and testing. The EEM model with selected feature groups is benchmarked with four machine-learning methods and three conventional regression models. Results show that the EEM model with the M2+G group, namely age, height, weight, gender, CYP2C9, VKORC1, and amiodarone, presents the largest coefficients of determination (R2), the highest percentage of the predicted dose within 20% of the actual dose (20%-p), the smallest mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root-mean-squared error on the test set, and the least decrease in R2 from the training set to the test set.

Methods: Electroencephalography or EEG signal is acquired from 16 mice in the Neural Interface Research (NIR) Laboratory of the City University of Hong Kong. We present a logistic regression based approach with mathematically uncomplicated feature extraction techniques for efficient hardware implementation to estimate the DOA. Results: With the extraction of only two features, the proposed system can classify the state of consciousness with 94% accuracy for a 1 second EEG epoch, leading to a 100% accurate channel prediction after a 7 s run-time on average. Conclusion: Through performance evaluation and comparative study confirmed the efficacy of the prototype. Significance: DOA is the measure of consciousness to distinguish whether a patient is suitably anesthetized or not during a surgical procedure. Traditionally the DOA is estimated by checking biophysical responses of a patient during the surgery. However, the physical symptoms can be misleading for a decisive conclusion due to the patient's health condition or as a side-effect of anesthetic drugs. Recently, several neuroscientific research works are correlating the EEG signal with conscious states, which is likely to have less interference with the patient's medical condition.

However, many existing machine learning methods have poor performance, and some existing CNN-based methods require high computational power, which considerably limits their real-world applications. To address these issues, in this paper, we propose an alternative HSI classification method based on the stacked contractive autoencoder (SCAE) and adaptive spectral-spatial information to improve the accuracy of HSI classification. Specifically, the non-subsampled shearlet transform (NSST) with the guided filtering (NG) enhances spatial structure information. Subsequently, we present an adaptive spatial information extraction method to extract the spatial information of pixels. Furthermore, we propose an HSI classification network, called SCAE-LR, for feature extraction and classification. The SCAE is implemented to extract the adaptive spectral-spatial feature, and a logistic regression (LR) layer is employed for classification. Extensive experiments on the Indian Pines data set and the Pavia University data set demonstrate the superior performance of our method.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3095265","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:61866009); Science and Technology Major Project of Guangxi(grant numbers:AA17202024); Guet Graduate Education(grant numbers:2017YJCX101); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9475983","Hyperspectral image;adaptive spectral-spatial information;logistic regression;image classification","Feature extraction;Information retrieval;Data mining;Transforms;Image reconstruction;Adaptive systems;Logistics","","6","","38","CCBY","7 Jul 2021","2021","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, 358 patients admitted to the First Hospital of Jilin University in Changchun for acute appendicitis in the past 5 years were included, and the data panel was constructed based on 32 factors collected. The framework comprised mainly of a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) algorithm and a Support Vector Machine(SVM) with new kernel function named the Mercer Support Vector Machine(MSVM) model and optimized by a Hunger Game Search (HGS) algorithm. First, the PCA was used to reduce the dimension of the data. Second, the HGS integrated into the MSVM was employed to train the parameter of the classification model MSVM to obtain the optimal model—Hunger Game Search (HGS-MSVM). Finally, based on the acute appendicitis data, comparative experiments were conducted between HGS-MSVM and five well-known machine-learning models, namely the Random Forest (RF), K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), MSVM, Logistic Regression (LR) and Discriminant Analysis (DA). The experimental data shows that the proposed model can achieve the best prediction performance, with a sensitivity, specificity, Matthews correlation coefficient(MCC), and accuracy(ACC) of 87.5%, 71.95%, 60.43%, and 81.65%, respectively.

Location tracking for mobile users is essential due to the correlated services and to improve the quality of service; however, it is challenging. On the other hand, the stateless predictive model is unsuitable due to lower accuracy and mismatched pattern analysis. This paper proposed a vehicle location prediction model using machine learning based on a case study of a campus shuttle bus scenario. Firstly, this paper comprehensively analyzes the recent research on vehicle location prediction models and provides a complete taxonomy. The proposed model uses the Support Vector Regression (SVR) based vehicle location predictive model in the implementation phase. In addition, a significant time-series predictive model, ARIMA, is configured and tested. Moreover, the seasonal ARIMA model is experimented with to predict the location of a mobile vehicle. The whole experiment is performed on a real dataset based on the university shuttle bus service. The results of the experiments, analysis, and discussions on the proposed model show the accuracy and effectiveness of its use on others. As a result, seasonal ARIMA outperformed ARIMA and SVR infractions.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3562785","UCSI University Research Excellence & Innovation Grant (REIG)(grant numbers:REIG-ICSDI-2024/044); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10971389","Location prediction;intelligent transportation systems;machine learning;SVR;ARIMA;SARIMA;and vehicle tracking","Predictive models;Hidden Markov models;Accuracy;Hands;Machine learning;Global Positioning System;Computational modeling;Analytical models;Real-time systems;Mathematical models","","2","","43","CCBY","21 Apr 2025","2025","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
