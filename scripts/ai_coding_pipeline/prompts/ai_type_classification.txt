You are an expert in AI technologies and their applications in educational settings.

Your task is to classify the TYPE of AI technology examined in each educational AI adoption study.

AI TYPE CATEGORIES:

1. **Generative AI**
   - Creates new content (text, images, code, audio, video)
   - Examples: ChatGPT, GPT-4, DALL-E, Midjourney, GitHub Copilot, Claude
   - Use cases: Content creation, writing assistance, code generation, image synthesis
   - Key feature: Produces novel outputs based on prompts

2. **Predictive AI**
   - Forecasts outcomes or makes predictions based on historical data
   - Examples: Recommendation systems, predictive analytics, forecasting models
   - Use cases: Sales forecasting, customer churn prediction, demand prediction, risk assessment
   - Key feature: Predicts future states or probabilities

3. **Decision Support AI**
   - Assists human decision-making with analysis and recommendations
   - Examples: Clinical decision support systems, expert systems, diagnostic AI
   - Use cases: Medical diagnosis, loan approval, hiring decisions, investment recommendations
   - Key feature: Augments human judgment with AI-driven insights

4. **Conversational AI**
   - Engages in natural language dialogue with users
   - Examples: Chatbots, virtual assistants, voice assistants (Siri, Alexa)
   - Use cases: Customer service, FAQ automation, personal assistants, tutoring
   - Key feature: Natural language interaction and response

5. **General AI / Multiple Types**
   - Study examines AI broadly without specifying type
   - Study examines multiple AI types simultaneously
   - Hypothetical or abstract AI (not specific technology)
   - Use cases: General "AI adoption" studies, theoretical frameworks

CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES:

1. **Look for explicit descriptions**:
   - "Participants were asked about their use of ChatGPT" → Generative AI
   - "The AI system predicts customer lifetime value" → Predictive AI
   - "Virtual assistant helps users find information" → Conversational AI

2. **Infer from context when not explicit**:
   - Focus on PRIMARY function of the AI
   - What does the AI actually DO in the study context?
   - What problem is it solving?

3. **Handle overlaps**:
   - Some AI systems have multiple capabilities (e.g., ChatGPT is both Generative AND Conversational)
   - Choose the PRIMARY or EMPHASIZED function in the study
   - If truly mixed emphasis, select "General AI / Multiple Types"

4. **Vignette studies**:
   - If study uses hypothetical scenarios, classify based on described AI functionality
   - Note in "notes" that it's a vignette/hypothetical study

5. **Unclear cases**:
   - If study just says "AI" without specifics → "General AI / Multiple Types"
   - If description is ambiguous → Choose most likely category and note uncertainty
   - If completely unclassifiable → "General AI / Multiple Types" with explanation

EXAMPLES BY EDUCATIONAL CONTEXT:

**Student-facing tools**:
- "ChatGPT for essay writing assistance" → Generative AI
- "AI tutoring system with dialogue" → Conversational AI
- "AI predicting student success/at-risk students" → Predictive AI
- "Adaptive learning platform adjusting difficulty" → Decision Support AI

**Instructor-facing tools**:
- "AI generating lesson plans or assessments" → Generative AI
- "AI-powered grading and feedback" → Decision Support AI
- "Early warning system for student retention" → Predictive AI
- "AI teaching assistant chatbot" → Conversational AI

**Institutional tools**:
- "AI for enrollment management" → Predictive AI
- "Plagiarism detection with AI" → Decision Support AI
- "AI chatbot for admissions inquiries" → Conversational AI

OUTPUT FORMAT:

Return a JSON object:

{
  "ai_type": "Generative AI|Predictive AI|Decision Support AI|Conversational AI|General AI",
  "ai_system_name": "specific name if mentioned (e.g., ChatGPT) or null",
  "ai_description": "brief description of what the AI does",
  "primary_function": "main function of AI in study context",
  "classification_confidence": "high|moderate|low",
  "is_hypothetical": boolean,
  "notes": "additional context or classification rationale"
}

EXAMPLES:

Example 1:
{
  "ai_type": "Generative AI",
  "ai_system_name": "ChatGPT",
  "ai_description": "Large language model for text generation and assistance",
  "primary_function": "Writing assistance and content creation for knowledge workers",
  "classification_confidence": "high",
  "is_hypothetical": false,
  "notes": "Study examines actual ChatGPT use in university coursework"
}

Example 2:
{
  "ai_type": "Decision Support AI",
  "ai_system_name": null,
  "ai_description": "Clinical decision support system for diagnosis",
  "primary_function": "Assists physicians with diagnostic recommendations",
  "classification_confidence": "high",
  "is_hypothetical": false,
  "notes": "AI analyzes patient data and suggests potential diagnoses"
}

Example 3:
{
  "ai_type": "Conversational AI",
  "ai_system_name": null,
  "ai_description": "Customer service chatbot",
  "primary_function": "Handles customer inquiries and provides support",
  "classification_confidence": "high",
  "is_hypothetical": false,
  "notes": "Text-based conversational interface for customer service"
}

Example 4:
{
  "ai_type": "Predictive AI",
  "ai_system_name": null,
  "ai_description": "Machine learning model for sales forecasting",
  "primary_function": "Predicts future sales based on historical data",
  "classification_confidence": "high",
  "is_hypothetical": false,
  "notes": "Uses regression and time series analysis"
}

Example 5 - General/unclear:
{
  "ai_type": "General AI",
  "ai_system_name": null,
  "ai_description": "Artificial intelligence technology",
  "primary_function": "Study examines general AI adoption without specifying type",
  "classification_confidence": "moderate",
  "is_hypothetical": true,
  "notes": "Vignette study using hypothetical AI without specific functionality described"
}

QUALITY CHECKS:
- Does classification match the described functionality?
- Is the confidence level appropriate given available information?
- Are notes sufficient to justify classification if ambiguous?
