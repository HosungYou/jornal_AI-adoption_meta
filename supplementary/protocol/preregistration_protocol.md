## 2. REVIEW RATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES

### 2.1 Background and Rationale

**Problem:** The rapid proliferation of AI technologies (generative AI, chatbots, predictive algorithms, autonomous systems) has created urgent questions about user acceptance and adoption. Traditional technology acceptance models (TAM, UTAUT) have dominated IS research for decades, but AI technologies possess unique characteristics that may require new theoretical constructs.

**Gap:** Existing meta-analyses focus on traditional IT/IS adoption (Sabherwal et al., 2006; Dwivedi et al., 2019) but predate the AI era. AI-specific constructs (trust in AI, AI anxiety, transparency expectations, autonomy concerns) have emerged in recent literature but remain fragmented across studies. No comprehensive meta-analytic synthesis has tested whether traditional models adequately explain AI adoption or whether AI-specific factors provide incremental explanatory power.

**Contribution:** This MASEM study will (1) synthesize correlational evidence across AI adoption studies, (2) test competing theoretical models using meta-analytic SEM, (3) quantify the relative importance of traditional vs. AI-specific determinants, and (4) identify moderators explaining heterogeneity.

### 2.2 Research Questions

**RQ1 (Model Comparison):** Do traditional technology acceptance models (TAM/UTAUT) adequately explain AI adoption, or do AI-specific constructs (trust, anxiety, transparency, autonomy) provide significant incremental variance explained?

- **Hypothesis H1a:** Model 1 (TAM/UTAUT Core) will show acceptable fit (CFI ≥ 0.90, RMSEA ≤ 0.08).
- **Hypothesis H1b:** Model 2 (Integrated) will show superior fit compared to Model 1 (ΔCFI ≥ 0.01, lower AIC/BIC).
- **Hypothesis H1c:** Model 2 (Integrated) will explain significantly more variance in BI and UB than Model 1 (ΔR² ≥ 0.05).

**RQ2 (Relative Importance):** What are the relative strengths of traditional TAM/UTAUT paths versus AI-specific paths in predicting behavioral intention and use behavior?

- **Hypothesis H2a:** Traditional paths (PE→BI, EE→BI) will show medium-to-large effects (β ≥ 0.30) based on prior IT meta-analyses (Sabherwal et al., 2006).
- **Hypothesis H2b:** AI-specific paths (TRU→BI, ANX→BI) will show significant effects after controlling for traditional predictors (|β| ≥ 0.15).
- **Hypothesis H2c:** Network centrality analysis will reveal BI, TRU, and PE as most central constructs (highest Strength centrality).

**RQ3 (Moderators):** How do study-level characteristics (AI type, culture, mandatory use, publication year) moderate the strength of key theoretical paths?

- **Hypothesis H3a:** Generative AI contexts will show stronger AI-specific paths (TRU→BI, ANX→BI) than predictive AI contexts.
- **Hypothesis H3b:** Collectivist cultures (East Asia) will show stronger SI→BI than individualist cultures (North America).
- **Hypothesis H3c:** Mandatory use contexts will show stronger FC→UB and weaker ATT→BI than voluntary use contexts.
- **Hypothesis H3d:** Recent studies (2023-2026) will show stronger AI-specific paths than early studies (2000-2018).

### 3.5 Data Collection

**3.5.1 AI-Assisted Extraction Pipeline**

We will use a six-phase AI-assisted extraction pipeline with human verification:

**Phase 0: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- Chunk PDFs, embed using all-MiniLM-L6-v2
- Create vector database per study for context retrieval

**Phase 1: Primary Extraction**
- Claude Sonnet 4.5 extracts correlation matrices, study metadata, constructs
- Confidence scoring on each extraction

**Phase 2: Construct Mapping**
- Claude maps study-specific labels to standardized 12-construct taxonomy
- Confidence levels: exact, high, moderate, low

**Phase 3: Multi-Model Consensus**
- Three AI models (Claude Sonnet, GPT-4o, Llama-3.3-70B) independently extract
- Agreement threshold: ≥2/3 models must agree

**Phase 4: Stratified Sampling for Human Verification**
- 20% sample stratified by publication year tertile, AI type, region
- Two human coders independently verify AI extractions

**Phase 5: Discrepancy Resolution**
- Human coders adjudicate all flagged discrepancies
- Senior author resolves any remaining conflicts

**Phase 6: Quality Assurance Gates**
- Automated checks: positive-definite matrices, r ∈ [-1,1], no duplicates, construct validity
- Manual review of outliers

4. **Construct mapping confidence**
   - Exclude "low confidence" mappings
   - Test robustness to construct harmonization decisions

5. **Missing data handling**
   - Available-case (pairwise deletion) vs. complete-case (listwise deletion)
   - Compare pooled matrices

   - Visual inspection for asymmetry
   - Separate plots for key paths (PE→BI, TRU→BI, etc.)

2. **Egger's Regression Test**

3. **PET-PEESE**
   - Precision-Effect Test (PET): meta-regress on SE
   - Precision-Effect Estimate with Standard Error (PEESE): meta-regress on variance
   - Estimate bias-corrected effect size

4. **Selection Models (if k ≥ 30)**
   - Three-parameter selection model (3PSM)
   - Estimate publication probability as function of p-value

5. **p-curve Analysis**
   - Test for evidential value vs. p-hacking
   - Right-skewed p-curve indicates genuine effects

**3.11.2 Interpretation**

- If publication bias detected: report bias-corrected estimates alongside observed estimates
- GRADE certainty downgraded if strong evidence of bias
- Discuss implications for conclusions

### 3.12 Certainty of Evidence Assessment

**3.12.1 GRADE Framework (Adapted for MASEM)**

For each key finding (path coefficient), assess certainty across five domains:

**1. Risk of Bias**
- Start at "High" certainty (correlational studies can provide high certainty for associations)
- Downgrade if >25% of weight from high risk-of-bias studies
- Downgrade if sensitivity analysis excluding high-RoB studies changes conclusion

**2. Inconsistency**
- Downgrade if I² > 75% (substantial heterogeneity)
- Downgrade if 95% prediction interval crosses zero (conflicting evidence)
- Do NOT downgrade if heterogeneity explained by moderators

**3. Indirectness**
- Downgrade if construct mapping predominantly "moderate" or "low" confidence
- Downgrade if outcome measurement indirect (e.g., intention as proxy for behavior)

**4. Imprecision**
- Downgrade if 95% CI includes both meaningful benefit and harm (CI crosses ±0.10)
- Downgrade if total N < 1,000

**5. Publication Bias**
- Downgrade if Egger's test p < 0.05 and funnel plot asymmetric
- Downgrade if PET-PEESE correction changes conclusion

**Certainty Ratings:**
- **High:** Very confident the true effect is close to estimate
- **Moderate:** Moderately confident; true effect likely close but possibly substantially different
- **Low:** Limited confidence; true effect may be substantially different
- **Very Low:** Very little confidence; true effect likely substantially different

**3.12.2 Summary of Findings Table**

For each of three models, report:
- Path coefficient (β) with 95% CI
- R² for BI and UB
- Number of studies (k), total N
- Heterogeneity (I²)
- Certainty rating (High/Moderate/Low/Very Low) with explanation
