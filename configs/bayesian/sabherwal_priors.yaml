bayesian_approach:
  rationale: |
    Use Scherer et al. (2019) education-specific meta-analytic estimates as primary informative priors for traditional TAM/UTAUT paths.
    Use Sabherwal et al. (2006) organizational IT priors as secondary reference.
    This approach:
    1. Incorporates decades of educational technology adoption research into educational AI adoption analysis
    2. Allows Bayesian updating: if educational AI differs from general educational technology, data will shift posterior away from prior
    3. Tests hypothesis: "Educational AI adoption ≠ general educational technology adoption" via prior-posterior comparison
    4. Provides more stable estimates for paths with limited educational AI-specific studies
    5. Education-specific priors are more relevant than organizational IT priors

  hypothesis_testing:
    h0: "Educational AI adoption paths = general educational technology adoption paths (posterior ≈ prior)"
    h1: "Educational AI adoption paths ≠ general educational technology adoption paths (posterior substantially different from prior)"
    metric: "Bayes Factor comparing prior vs. posterior distributions"

  student_vs_teacher_note: |
    Scherer et al. (2019) focused on teachers. For student priors, use wider distributions (less prior information available).
    Student populations may show:
    - Stronger SI→BI (peer influence stronger for students)
    - Weaker ATT→BI (students have less choice/autonomy)
    - Similar PE→BI, EE→BI paths

combined_priors_guidance:
  description: "How to integrate Sabherwal (organizational IT) and Scherer (education) priors"
  recommendation: |
    For educational AI adoption:
    1. PRIMARY: Use Scherer et al. (2019) education-specific priors for teacher/instructor studies
    2. SECONDARY: Use Sabherwal et al. (2006) organizational IT priors as robustness check
    3. STUDENTS: Use wider SD on Scherer priors (multiply SD by 1.5) due to less prior information
    4. SENSITIVITY: Run models with both prior sets and compare posteriors

    teacher_instructor_studies: "Use Scherer (2019) priors"
    student_studies: "Use Scherer (2019) priors with wider SD (×1.5)"

    general_public: "Use Sabherwal (2006) priors or weakly informative"

weakly_informative_priors:
  description: "AI-specific paths: No prior IT literature; use weakly informative priors centered at zero"
  rationale: |
    No general IT meta-analyses include AI-specific constructs (trust, anxiety, transparency, autonomy).
    Use weakly informative N(0, 0.20) priors:
    - Mean = 0: No strong directional expectation from prior data
    - SD = 0.20: Allows wide range (-0.40 to +0.40 covers 95% prior probability)
    - Regularization: Prevents overfitting but allows data to dominate

    mean: 0.00

    distribution: "normal"
    mean: 0.00
    sd: 0.20
    theoretical_expectation: "negative (β ≈ −0.20 to −0.30)"

    distribution: "normal"
    mean: 0.00

    distribution: "normal"
    mean: 0.00

    distribution: "normal"
    mean: 0.00
