REC_00366,Reliability and validity of the reduced Spanish version of the Prenatal Breastfeeding Self‐Efficacy Scale,"Breastfeeding self‐efficacy is a relevant predictor of exclusive breastfeeding during the first six months of life. The Prenatal Breastfeeding Self‐Efficacy Scale (PBSES) is a 20‐item tool developed to determine breastfeeding self‐efficacy during pregnancy. Our study aimed to assess the structural validity and psychometric characteristics of the PBSES and to explore item reduction according to the statistical criteria for parsimony and incremental validity. In this study, conducted in six hospitals in eastern Spain, we recruited 1183 women with healthy, full‐term, single‐birth newborns. Data on sociodemographic, breastfeeding‐related variables, and the PBSES, were obtained from self‐administered questionnaires during the third trimester of pregnancy, at postpartum discharge, and 5 months postpartum, and from a phone survey 12 months postpartum. Item reduction was conducted after revising the PBSES item floor and ceiling effects, interitem correlations, and item–score relationships with breastfeeding‐status variables during follow‐up. The factorial structure of the short form of the PBSES (PBSES‐SF) was tested using both exploratory and confirmatory approaches. After item reduction, the confirmatory factor analysis of the 12 remaining items of the PBSES‐SF revealed adequate fit statistics for a three‐factor structure and a second‐order factor. Internal consistency was measured using the Cronbach's α coefficient of the PBSES‐SF (0.86). We provided evidence on the discriminant validity of the PBSES‐SF by comparing its scores between known groups, convergent validity by examining its correlations with other variables, and predictive validity by assessing the association of PBSES‐SF scores with breastfeeding behavior at critical points in time during the first postpartum year.

REC_00381,"Investigating identity‐related weak developmental assets and their barriers in Iranian female adolescents: Self‐worth, self‐efficacy, and personal power","Achievement of a positive identity and its transition to adulthood is the most important task of the adolescent era. This cross‐sectional explanatory mixed‐method study sought to better understand barriers to identity development in female adolescents in Iran by explaining their own experiences and using a Positive Youth Development model as a framework. A total of 573 female secondary‐school students were recruited through multistage sampling and were asked to complete the questionnaire of Developmental Assets Profile (DAP). Positive identity in DAP consists of four assets (personal power, self‐esteem, a positive view of the personal future, and sense of purpose). Quantitative data analysis showed that among above mentioned four assets, personal power and self‐esteem gained lower scores. A qualitative study held six individual interviews and two focused‐group discussions were conducted to explain the barriers to personal power and self‐esteem. Results showed that considering personal power, there were two categories as follows: (1) barriers to a sense of control over life and future (subcategories: being limited by failures, deprivation of liberty, and dissatisfaction from being excessively controlled by parents). (2) Barriers to adequately dealing with the challenges and problems (subcategories: expressing feelings inappropriately, isolation, and blaming). Barriers to self‐esteem included categories of negative emotions due to weak academic performance, weak religious performance, weak communication with parents, and previous mistakes. The results of the present study highlighted the areas that need intervention in the field of promoting positive identity in adolescent girls and their parents.

REC_00431,Exploring the role of school-based clinics in pre-service teachers preparation: A mixed-methods study of a School-University Partnership in Australia,"Effective school-university partnerships (SUPs) are a key policy focus in initial teacher education (ITE) in Australia and internationally. This article presents an overview of the school-based clinical model employed in one Australian SUP and discusses the role of this model in the learning and preparation of pre-service teachers (PSTs) within it. A pilot study with a mixed-methods approach was conducted to determine the key differences in PSTs' experiences between the campus-based learning approach with traditional practicum placement and the school-based clinic modes of learning. Informed by the qualitative findings of the pilot study, a quantitative survey was then developed to explore PSTs' experiences of the school-based clinic modes of learning. Using the validated survey, a follow-up main study investigated PSTs' experiences through a series of quantitative analyses. PSTs reported that their participation in school-based clinics significantly contributes to their preparation for teaching, including their self-efficacy and classroom readiness, compared to their experience of campus-based learning models with the traditional practicum placement. Given the imperative for ITE to ensure PSTs are provided with high-quality, authentic learning experiences that prepare them for the complexities of the teaching profession, this paper provides one way in which ITE programmes can enhance the learning experiences of their students. As the first of its kind and scale, the SUP and the school-based clinics model within it provide a model that other providers could follow to further enhance their own students' learning and preparation for the profession.","Morrissey, C; Lee, M; Kim, E; Halcrow, K; Hills, E",2024,REVIEW OF EDUCATION,10.1002/rev3.70015,12.0,3,nan-nan,English,Australia; initial teacher education; pre-service teachers preparation; school-based clinics; school-university partnership; SUP,2049-6613,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_00909,Predictors of K-12 teachers’ instructional strategies with ICTs,"The goal of this study is to identify the relationship between K-12 teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs, classroom goal structure and use of instructional strategies. The study also aims to determine if there is variance in the relationship between these constructs for primary versus secondary school teachers. Data collection involved completion of a self-report survey by 810 primary and secondary school teachers in Thailand. Results revealed that personal and ICT teaching self-efficacy directly predicted both mastery and performance classroom goal structures for K-12 teachers. Mastery classroom goal structure predicted deep learning. Performance classroom goal structure predicted surface learning. ICT teaching self-efficacy was the strongest predictor of teachers’ instructional strategies with ICTs. Results also revealed that primary teachers’ performance classroom goal structure was positively associated with the use of deep-learning strategies with ICTs and student-centered learning with ICTs. In contrast, for secondary teachers, mastery classroom goal structure was positively associated with student-centered learning with ICTs, whereas both mastery and performance classroom goal structures were positively associated with the use of deep-learning strategies with ICTs. Results of this study suggest that classroom goal structure may be different for ICT classrooms than for regular classrooms. Implications relate to the need to help teachers design ICT activities that reflect both performance and mastery classroom goal structures.

REC_01044,"Risk and protective factors associated with lifetime sexual experience among rural, reservation-based American Indian youth","Early sexual initiation is a catalyst for sexually transmitted infection and unintended pregnancy. American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) youth initiate sex prior to age 13 more often than other U.S. youth, contributing to current inequalities in sexual health. Identifying what factors were associated with lifetime sexual experience among AI/AN youth can inform the development of primary prevention programming to delay sexual initiation, alleviate the costs of early sexual activity, and improve sexual health outcomes in this population. We analyzed cross-sectional data from 267 AI youth ages 13–19, recruited from a rural, reservation-based community. We used multivariate logistic regression models to estimate associations between independent variables and lifetime sexual experience (vaginal and/or anal sex) across the following categories: sociodemographic, knowledge, attitudes/perceptions, beliefs, intentions, skills, behaviors, and theoretical constructs. The sample was 56.2% female, mean age 15.1 years (SD = 1.7), and 22.5% were sexually experienced. In our final model, condom use self-efficacy (attitude/perception factor) and intentions to remain abstinent until marriage (intention factor) were associated with lower odds of lifetime sexual experience. Age (sociodemographic factor), intention to have sex (intention factor), use of any contraception (behavior factor), and higher response efficacy (theoretical construct) were associated with lifetime sexual experience. Of these, intention to have sex was the strongest indicator. These results both corroborate and contrast with other research conducted among rural, reservation-based AI/AN youth. Our findings show programs targeting intentions may have the greatest impact among reservation-based AI youth, and justify program delivery stratified by age group in this setting.

REC_01363,"Differences between meditators and non-meditators in mindfulness, its components and related qualities","Objectives: The study investigated (1) if meditators and non-meditators differ in their levels of mindfulness, attention, acceptance, loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and empathy; and (2) whether and how mindfulness practice affected the above qualities. Methods: The 241 participants (18–81 years, M = 40.3, SD = 14.8; 64% female) completed an online questionnaire consisting of scales measuring mindfulness components (mindful attention, acceptance, non-judging), and mindfulness related qualities, including loving-kindness, compassion, joy, equanimity, and empathy. The participants who reported being meditators (N = 122; 50.4%) were also asked questions about their meditation practice. Results: Meditators differed significantly from non-meditators in relation to their levels of mindful attention (t(239) = 4.80, p< .001, d = .63) and empathy (t(239) = 2.80, p< .01, d = .37) but not for the other mindfulness components or related qualities. Multiple regression analyses indicated that practice variables (years of practice, frequency of practice, and length of session) explained a significant proportion of variance in mindful attention (R² = .27, p< .001) and empathy (R² = .15, p< .05). Conclusions: The present findings are consistent with conceptualizations of mindfulness that focus on the centrality of mindful attention over acceptance and non-judging components, which is consistent with several Buddhist mindfulness traditions. Present findings also demonstrate the importance of practice for the cultivation of mindful attention. Future studies are required to increase our understanding of effects relating to the type of mindfulness undertaken and the influence of practice factors.

REC_01379,Psychometric evaluation of a Chinese translation of the relational and individual self-expansion scales,"The self-expansion theory suggests that acquiring novel experiences, perspectives, and resources can expand people's self-concepts (Aron & Aron, 1986). Many studies have demonstrated the implications of self-expansion for wellbeing in interpersonal and nonrelational contexts. Although scholars have proposed that self-expansion is a basic human motivation, research that supports its cross-cultural generalizability is limited. The present study aimed to contribute to the research (a) by validating a Chinese translation of the Self-Expansion Questionnaire (SEQ, Lewandowski & Aron, 2002) and the Individual Self-Expansion Questionnaire (ISEQ, Mattingly & Lewandowski, 2013)-the established measures of self-expansion in relational and nonrelational contexts, respectively; and (b) by assessing psychometric properties of a measure of the general self-expansion which modified and combined the SEQ and ISEQ. Study 1 conducted an online survey among 335 undergraduate students and examined the factor structures of the scales using exploratory factor analyses. Study 2 aimed to assess the scales among working adults (N = 327) and conducted a confirmatory factor analysis. Both the studies measured openness to experience, sensation seeking, and epistemic curiosity to test convergent validity of the self-expansion scales; and assessed their predictive validity by including self-efficacy, self-esteem, positive and negative affect, and life satisfaction. Findings of the two studies showed that the Chinese scales had good internal reliability and validity, suggesting their applicability to Chinese adult populations. We discussed possible differences in the self-expansion of Chinese and members of individualist cultures and provided questions for future research on general self-expansion.","Liu, SS; Peng, M; Lewandowski, GW",2023,CURRENT PSYCHOLOGY,10.1007/s12144-021-02585-8,42.0,15,12671-12681,English,Self-expansion; Reliability; Validity; China; Relationship,1046-1310,Article,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO
REC_01691,Are AI Tools Effective in Reducing Cognitive Load or Boosting Writing Self-Efficacy for L2 Postgraduates?,"The extent to which postgraduate students benefit from AI tools in research-based second-language (L2) writing remains underexplored. This study examined how AI usage impacts writing self-efficacy and cognitive load among postgraduates with varying levels of L2 literacy. A mixed-methods approach was employed, combining questionnaire surveys with semi-structured interviews. The findings showed that AI tools significantly benefited only those with lower L2 literacy: AI use positively predicted increased writing self-efficacy without affecting perceived cognitive load. In contrast, for postgraduates with higher L2 literacy, increased AI use did not correlate with improved writing self-efficacy or reduced cognitive load. Qualitative data further indicated that students with lower L2 proficiency primarily valued AI tools for reading lengthy texts along with other benefits. However, those with higher proficiency expressed strong reservations about relying on AI for evaluative reading and idea planning. These findings offer valuable insights for academic writing instructors, supporting informed decisions on the integration and effective use of AI technologies in academic writing instruction.","Zhang, ZY; Wang, CY; Shang, YH",2025,ASIA-PACIFIC EDUCATION RESEARCHER,10.1007/s40299-025-01031-8,,,nan-nan,English,AI tools; ChatGPT; Academic writing; Postgraduates; Self-efficacy; Cognitive load,0119-5646,Article; Early Access,WoS; Scopus
REC_01891,Towards digital information literacy guidelines for African libraries: a survey of the relationship between digital and information literacy of university students in Ghana,"The relationship between digital literacy and information literacy has been suggested in many studies. Despite this suggestion, research providing context-related data and research findings for university librarians and educators in Ghana is inadequate. This has left many academic librarians with the difficult task of training students for the digital world on their own, with insufficient resources to provide guidance. The insufficient resources include context-relevant data to guide policy, clear research findings to support actions and evidence to convince university policy makers about the need for course reform and increased access to technology. This paper uses a correlational design in a sample of Ghanaian university students. It investigates the relationship between digital literacy, information literacy, access to and use of technology and intention to use technology. Pearson correlation coefficients were computed for pairwise relationships between the variables. The relationship between information literacy and digital literacy was conceptualized as digital information literacy and backed with data from the study. Correlations between digital literacy and information literacy were supported, and a simple linear regression further showed that information literacy predicts digital literacy. A correlation between the intention to use technology and digital literacy, as well as information literacy and intention to use technology, was supported. The findings suggest that academic librarians in Africa improve information literacy training to cover digital topics. University policy makers are advised to improve access to and use of digital technology, be open to the ethical use of digital sources of information and ensure that all students receive training in digital sources of information and new approaches.","Akakpo, MG; Ahardy, DO; Kumankumah, SS",2025,JOURNAL OF ACADEMIC LIBRARIANSHIP,10.1016/j.acalib.2025.103067,51.0,4,nan-nan,English,Digital information literacy; Higher education; Generative artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Access to technology; Use intention; African academic librarians; Ghana,0099-1333,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_01957,Alcohol use severity among Hispanic emerging adults: Examining the roles of bicultural self-efficacy and acculturation,"Objective: This study aimed to (1) examine respective associations of acculturation orientations (e.g., U.S. orientation and Hispanic orientation) and domains (e.g., social groundedness and role repertoire) of bicultural self-efficacy, the perceived confidence to function effectively within the receiving culture and the heritage culture, with alcohol use severity among Hispanic emerging adults. This study also aimed to (2) examine potential moderating factors of respective associations among acculturation orientations and bicultural self-efficacy with alcohol use severity. Method: 200 Hispanic emerging adults from Arizona (n = 99) and Florida (n = 101) completed a cross-sectional survey. Inclusion criteria were being ages 18-25, self-identify as Hispanic or Latina/o, and currently living in Maricopa County or Miami-Dade County. Data were analyzed using hierarchical multiple regression and moderation analyses. Results: Findings indicate that neither of the acculturation orientations nor role repertoire had main effects with alcohol use severity. However, higher social groundedness was associated with lower alcohol use severity. Moderation analyses indicate that the interaction between the U.S. orientation and study site and the interaction between the Hispanic orientation and social groundedness were statistically significant in relation to alcohol use severity. Conclusions: Considering that the U.S. orientation was associated with alcohol use severity only in Arizona highlights the need for multisite studies on acculturation. Our findings demonstrate that other sociocultural processes such as acculturation can impact bicultural self-efficacy; and that the association between bicultural self-efficacy and alcohol merits further investigation. However, more thorough assessments of bicultural self-efficacy are needed to better understand its effects on alcohol.","Cano, MA; Sánchez, M; De La Rosa, M; Rojas, P; Ramírez-Ortiz, D; Bursac, Z; Meca, A; Schwartz, SJ; Lorenzo-Blanco, E; Zamboanga, BL; Garcini, LM; Roncancio, AM; Arbona, C; Sheehan, DM; de Dios, MA",2020,ADDICTIVE BEHAVIORS,10.1016/j.addbeh.2020.106442,108.0,,nan-nan,English,Alcohol; Biculturalism; Enculturation; Latino; Young adults,0306-4603,Article,WoS; PsycINFO
REC_02676,Value attitude behaviour and social stigma in the adoption of veganism: An integrated model,"While veganism has been growing and receiving increasing attention, there is a gap on how factors such as health and environmental beliefs and anti-speciesism values, that create attitude towards their diets, influence their vegan behaviour. Furthermore, the role of social stigma experienced by vegans has not been examined within this context. Building on the value-attitude-behaviour model, the present study addresses this gap by conceptualizing these different streams of variables to build a testable conceptual framework for understanding how these factors contribute to maintaining a vegan lifestyle. The study uses structural equation modelling to analyse the data on 315 vegan consumers, testing the framework and its variables. The study shows that the value‐attitude‐behaviour model can successfully be applied to vegan behaviour. The findings show that anti-speciesism values are strong predictors of a positive attitude toward a vegan diet. Furthermore, social stigma does not inhibit consumers from maintaining a vegan lifestyle. Ultimately, the study contributes to a novel multifaceted model for understanding veganism in broader terms, allowing for the examination of other influencing factors on a complex outcome. The findings are useful for policymakers and marketing practitioners to engage in understanding behavioural segments.

REC_02801,Exploring the use of arcade game elements for attitude change: Two studies in the aviation safety domain,"[Correction Notice: An Erratum for this article was reported in Vol 133 of International Journal of Human-Computer Studies (see record 2019-63958-007). In the original article, due to a translation mistake, the term “mediating” occurs four times in the paper with an informal meaning that does not reflect the formal statistical usage of the adjective. The four occurrences of “mediating role” in the paper should be substituted with “role”.] Gamification and serious games are increasingly employed for attitude change purposes. However, they frequently exploit a limited set of game elements, such as points, badges and leaderboards, and scarcely explore the use of more complex elements that make games engaging. In this paper, we focus on game elements from the arcade genre, and their use in serious games for attitude change. In particular, we propose a serious game for mobile devices that employs arcade game elements for attitude change in aviation safety, and we assess its effects with two different studies. The first study compares the immediate effects of the serious game vs. the traditional approach (safety card), showing that the game is more engaging and can improve attitudes towards aircraft emergencies in terms of users’ self-efficacy and perceived vulnerability to the risk. The second study assesses the effects of the serious game when used over time (1-week) in a naturalistic setting, showing that the game can engage users and increase knowledge about correct and wrong behaviors. In both studies, engagement turned out to play a mediating role that we analyze in detail.

REC_02938,Work-schedule management in psychiatric hospitals and its associations with nurses' emotional exhaustion and intention to leave: A cross-sectional multicenter study,"Background: Managing nurses' work schedules in hospitals is challenging because employer needs, like shift changes at short notice and overtime, may conflict with nurses' desires for a predictable and stable schedule. Nurses should have a certain degree of control over their work schedules, and their supervisors should support their needs in scheduling. How perceived control over work schedules, perceived support from supervisors in scheduling, shift changes at short notice, and overtime affect nurses' emotional exhaustion and intentions to leave has not been studied. Objectives: The aims are (1) to describe perceived control, perceived supervisor support, shift changes at short notice, and overtime among nurses in psychiatric hospitals; (2) to assess the variation of these four factors between units at psychiatric hospitals; and (3) to investigate the association between these factors with nurses' emotional exhaustion and intentions to leave. Design: Cross-sectional survey study. Setting(s): Swiss psychiatric hospitals with 24-hour services. Participants: Registered nurses (N = 994) from 114 adult-inpatient units. Methods: To describe perceived control, perceived supervisor support, shift changes at short notice, and overtime among nurses, we calculated frequencies, percentages, means, and standard deviations of their responses to the survey. To assess the variation between units, we computed intraclass correlations for the four factors. We constructed random-effects models accounting for the clustering of nurses in units for emotional exhaustion and intentions to leave separately. Results: Perception of work-schedule control was 3.32 (SD 1.39, range 0–5); perception of supervisor work-schedule support was 3.28 (SD 1.14, range 0–4). On average, 9 % of the nurses had to take over a shift at short notice at least three times per month, and 40 % worked at least 15 minute overtime on their most recent shift. Intraclass correlation for all four factors was higher than 0.05. Emotional exhaustion was significantly associated with supervisor support and overtime, and leaving intentions were significantly associated with perceived control, supervisor support and overtime. Conclusion: Perceived control, perceived supervisor support, shift changes at short notice, and overtime are promising factors for interventions to prevent nurses' emotional exhaustion and allay their intentions to leave. Unit managers should provide nurses with increased predictability and influence on their work schedules. This could reduce early career endings and early retirement and counteract nurse shortages.

REC_02965,"Intention to use wearable health devices and its predictors among diabetes mellitus patients in Amhara region referral hospitals, Ethiopia: Using modified UTAUT-2 model","Introduction: The burden of diabetes mellitus is increasing in Africa. Wearables have a proven track record of combating chronic diseases. However, little is known about patients’ intentions to use such technologies in resource-limited settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess DM patients' intentions to use wearable health devices and its predictors in Ethiopia. Methods: An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted among 924 diabetes mellitus patients from May 19 to June 23, 2022, at referral hospitals in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia. An interviewer-administered questionnaire was used to collect the data using the Kobo Collect app. A systematic random sampling technique was used to select the study participants. Descriptive statistics were done using SPSS version 25 software and presented using tables and pie charts. Structural equation modeling analysis with SPSS AMOS version 26 software was employed to identify predictors associated with the intention to use wearable health devices in Ethiopia. Results: A total of 883 diabetes mellitus patients, with a 95.56% response rate, participated in the study. The proportion of intention to use wearable health devices was 47.1%, 95% CI (43.7–50.5). Effort expectancy (β = 0.543, P < 0.01), performance expectancy (β = 0.306, P < 0.01), facilitating condition (β = 0.131, P < 0.05), and habit (β = 0.093, P < 0.05) had a positive direct relationship with intention to use wearable health devices. Age (β = 0.439, p < 0.001) was moderate performance expectancy, while gender (β = 0.780, p < 0.001) had moderate effort expectancy to the intention to use wearable health devices. Conclusions: Overall, diabetes mellitus patients’ intentions to use wearable health devices were promising. The intention to use wearables was positively related to effort expectancy, performance expectancy, facilitating conditions, and habit. Thus, increasing patient intention to utilize it could be achieved through capacity building, access to technology, and technical support. In addition, implementers should prioritize improving the availability of devices, patients' abilities, encouraging customers, to utilize the product on a regular basis by actively fostering their relationship with them, and create awareness about usefulness of wearable health devices. © 2022 The Authors","Walle, A.D.; Jemere, A.T.; Tilahun, B.; Endehabtu, B.F.; Wubante, S.M.; Melaku, M.S.; Tegegne, M.D.; Gashu, K.D.",2023,Informatics in Medicine Unlocked,10.1016/j.imu.2022.101157,36,,nan-nan,English,Diabetes mellitus; Ethiopia; Patient's intention; Wearable health devices,23529148,Article,Scopus
REC_03174,The relationship between parental stress and psychological adjustment of the children: The role of parental psychological flexibility as a mediator,"There is growing interest in parental psychological flexibility, understood as parents' ability to enjoy an optimal relationship with their children by accepting their negative emotions and thoughts in the present moment, while remaining child-conscious, in value-based parenting. Parenting can sometimes be stressful, especially when faced with the varied and changing challenges of parenthood. Parental stress, in turn, has been related to high levels of psychological inflexibility. So, this study aimed to analyze the relationship of parental psychological flexibility with parental stress and its impact on children's psychological adjustment. The sample consisted of 909 families with children aged 3–18 years who answered the following questionnaires: The Parental Acceptance Questionnaire (6-PAQ), which measures psychological flexibility, the Parental Stress Scale (PSS), and the Strenght and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ), which studies the general psychological state of children and adolescents by screening for emotional and behavioral difficulties. These variables were analyzed by difference analysis according to the level of psychological flexibility, regression analysis, and mediation analysis. The group of parents who scored highest on psychological inflexibility scored high on parental stress and the child psychological adjustment scales, except for the prosocial behavior subscale. The results show that parental psychological inflexibility is related to higher levels of parental stress, and in turn, has an impact on greater psychological maladjustment in children. These relationships are analyzed from their clinical and educational implications as factors and objectives to be incorporated into family intervention.

REC_03266,Vaccine hesitancy towards childhood immunizations as a predictor of mothers’ intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 in Saudi Arabia,"Background: Despite the success of childhood immunization in reducing vaccine-preventable diseases, vaccine hesitancy is now a global health threat to this achievement. The current COVID-19 pandemic may change the picture of vaccine hesitancy toward childhood immunizations, which could influence the mothers’ intention to vaccinate their children against COVID-19. Aim: To measure the prevalence and related factors of vaccine hesitancy towards childhood immunization during the era of COVID-19 along with the prevalence of mothers’ intention to vaccinate their children the future COVID-19 and its association with childhood vaccine hesitancy. Methods: Cross sectional study was conducted among 270 Saudi mothers attending outpatient clinics at King Abdullah University Hospital (KAAUH) in Riyadh by purposive sampling technique. Data were collected from January to February 2021 using SAGE Group standardized questionnaire. Results: Although most mothers strongly agree on the importance of the vaccine (79%), almost one-fourth of mothers were hesitant towards childhood immunization (24.31%). Similar percentage of mothers’ intended to vaccinate their children against COVID-19 in the next 6 months was reported (24%). Vaccine hesitancy was found to be a significant predictor of mothers’ intention. Mothers’ education level was significantly associated with being hesitant towards childhood immunization as well as the intention to accept the future COVID-19 vaccine (p < 0.05).

REC_03534,The development and psychometric testing of a Disaster Response Self-Efficacy Scale among undergraduate nursing students,"Background: Disaster nurse education has received increasing importance in China. Knowing the abilities of disaster response in undergraduate nursing students is beneficial to promote teaching and learning. However, there are few valid and reliable tools that measure the abilities of disaster response in undergraduate nursing students. Objectives: To develop a self-report scale of self-efficacy in disaster response for Chinese undergraduate nursing students and test its psychometric properties. Participants and Settings: Nursing students (N = 318) from two medical colleges were chosen by purposive sampling. Methods: The Disaster Response Self-Efficacy Scale (DRSES) was developed and psychometrically tested. Reliability and content validity were studied. Construct validity was tested by exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Reliability was tested by internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Results: The DRSES consisted of 3 factors and 19 items with a 5-point rating. The content validity was 0.91, Cronbach's alpha coefficient was 0.912, and the intraclass correlation coefficient for test-retest reliability was 0.953. The construct validity was good (chi(2)/df = 2.440, RMSEA = 0.068, NFI = 0.907, CFI = 0.942, IFI = 0.430, p < 0.001). Conclusions: The newly developed DRSES has proven good reliability and validity. It could therefore be used as an assessment tool to evaluate self-efficacy in disaster response for Chinese undergraduate nursing students.","Li, HY; Bi, RX; Zhong, QL",2017,NURSE EDUCATION TODAY,10.1016/j.nedt.2017.07.009,59.0,,16-20,English,Disasters response; Measure; Self-efficacy; Nurse student; Competency,0260-6917,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_03576,Nursing students' pain management self-efficacy and attitude towards patients with chronic pain: What can be done better in education? A cross-sectional study,"Aim: This study has been conducted to determine nursing students' pain management self-efficacy and attitudes towards patients with chronic pain. Background: Pain is a significant phenomenon that often leads individuals to seek medical attention, influenced by various factors and commonly encountered by healthcare professionals. Adequate knowledge and positive attitudes among nurses play a crucial role in the thorough assessment and effective management of pain, resulting in favorable outcomes for hospitalized individuals. Design: This study used a descriptive cross-sectional design. Methods: The research was conducted with 322 undergraduate students who were continuing their education in the autumn semester of the 2023-2024 academic year at Aksaray University, Faculty of Health Sciences, Department of Nursing. Data have been collected by using Student Information Form, Pain Management SelfEfficacy Questionnaire (PMSEQ) and the Attitude of Healthcare Professionals towards Patients with Chronic Pain Scale. Mann-Whitney U, Kruskal-Wallis significance test and Spearman Correlation analysis have been used to evaluate the data. Results: The mean total score of the PMSEQ was 62.91 (SD 15.58) and the mean total score of the Attitude of Healthcare Professionals Towards Patients with Chronic Pain Scale was 3.94 (SD.52). Those students who willingly opted for the nursing profession, perceived themselves as proficient in managing chronic pain, administered care to patients experiencing pain during clinical placements, believed they received sufficient education in pain management throughout their studies and rated their overall health status as very poor demonstrated higher levels of self-efficacy in pain management (p<0.05). As a result of the analysis performed according to the mean scores of the Attitude of Healthcare Professionals Towards Chronic Pain Patients Scale and its sub-dimensions of the students participating in the study, a statistically significant difference has been found according to their gender, academic year and self-sufficiency in pain management (p<0.05). It has been determined that there is a weak positive correlation between the total mean scores of the participants' PMSEQ and the Attitude of Healthcare Professionals Towards Patients with Chronic Pain scale (r=.260; p<0.01). Conclusions: In this study, as nursing students' self-confidence in pain management self-efficacy increased, their attitudes towards patients with pain also increased positively. In the nursing curriculum, there is a necessity for integrating pain management education and fostering awareness to adequately equip nursing students in addressing the pain requirements of patients.","Kasar, KS; Yilmaz, CK",2024,NURSE EDUCATION IN PRACTICE,10.1016/j.nepr.2024.104043,79.0,,nan-nan,English,Pain; Pain management; Self-efficacy; Attitude; Nursing students,1471-5953,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_03612,The scales of general well-being (SGWB),"This paper presents the development and validation of a new well-being questionnaire: the Scales of General Well-Being (SGWB). A review of current measures identified fourteen common constructs as lower-order indicators of well-being: happiness, vitality, calmness, optimism, involvement, self-awareness, self-acceptance, self-worth, competence, development, purpose, significance, self-congruence and connection. Three studies were then conducted. In study 1, the item pool was developed and the adequacy of its content to assess each of the fourteen constructs was evaluated by consulting a panel of six subject expert academics. In study 2, the dimensionality was assessed in an adult North American sample (N = 560). The results supported the hierarchical factor structure. In study 3, further evidence confirmed the factor structure, and provided support for the measure's internal and test-retest reliability, measurement invariance across gender, age and a longitudinal period of 5weeks, and criterion validity in an adult North American sample (N = 1101). The SGWB promises to be a useful research tool that provides both a global measure of well-being as well as a collection of fourteen individual health-related scales.

REC_03778,Research self-efficacy in early-career pharmacists: Tool validation and correlation with personal attributes,"Introduction: Self-efficacy in research and personal characteristics of pharmacists are necessary to lead and implement pharmaceutical research strategies. This study primarily aimed to confirm the validity of the Research Self-Efficacy Scale (RSES) among early-career pharmacists; a secondary objective was to assess participants' perspectives on research self-efficacy while considering personal characteristics, such as strategic thinking and leadership. Methods: Using an exploratory factor analysis and internal consistency measure, the RSES scale validity and reliability were assessed among Lebanese early-career pharmacists. Its association with personal attributes, such as global self-efficacy, leadership, and strategic thinking, was also assessed through correlation with validated measures. Results: The RSES scale was found to be valid and reliable. Pharmacists from foreign universities scored higher on the RSES compared to their counterparts from Lebanese institutions. Additionally, a positive correlation was found between self-efficacy, generalized self-efficacy, and strategic thinking scores, while differences between universities and year of study did not reach statistical significance. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the RSES is a valid and reliable tool for assessing research self-efficacy among early-career pharmacists in Lebanon. Several strategies could be implemented at the institutional and national levels to strengthen self-efficacy and cultivate a sustainable research environment. These include enhancing educational frameworks, integrating research opportunities, and fostering international collaborations. Future research using this validated scale will be instrumental in evaluating the effectiveness of such interventions.","Hajj, A; Sacre, H; Haddad, C; Elia, J; El Ghawi, J; Haidar, L; Dimachkieh, L; Nasrallah, M; Safwan, J; Rahme, D; Basma, S; Pascale, S",2026,EXPLORATORY RESEARCH IN CLINICAL AND SOCIAL PHARMACY,10.1016/j.rcsop.2025.100693,21.0,,nan-nan,English,Pharmacy; Research; Research self-efficacy; Global self-efficacy; Strategic thinking; Leadership; Education,,Article,WoS
REC_03823,AI chatbots in higher education: Students' beliefs and concerns,"The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools in educational settings has garnered significant attention due to its potential to transform learning experiences. The main goal of this study is to analyse the usage, beliefs, and concerns of AI chatbots among university students in Slovenia providing a comprehensive analysis that informs both academic practices and policy-making. We used a structured questionnaire with a sample of 422 participants reflecting a diverse demographic profile across various fields of study. The questionnaire was designed to measure the patterns of AI chatbot usage, students' perceptions and concerns towards AI's potential benefits and drawbacks in education. Statistical analyses, including Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and the Chi-square test, were utilized to test hypotheses concerning differences in AI chatbot usage, beliefs and concerns based on the level and field of study. The results reveal that Slovenian students are very cautious regarding the capabilities of AI chatbots. A significant majority of students express concern that dependence on AI chatbots could negatively affect two fundamental skills in education: creative writing skills and critical thinking. On the other hand, a majority of students disagree with the statement that over-dependence on AI chatbots could destroy the purpose of education. The findings suggest that there is a critical need to address the educational, ethical, and psychological impacts of AI technologies. The results highlight the necessity for further research into the educational implications of AI, suggesting a balanced and sustainable approach to integrating these technologies into higher education curricula. Such an approach ensures that the adoption of AI not only enhances learning outcomes but also aligns with the principles of sustainability, promoting long-term benefits for both education and society.","Fosner, A; Aver, B",2025,SUSTAINABLE FUTURES,10.1016/j.sftr.2025.100734,9.0,,nan-nan,English,AI chatbots; Higher education; Students' beliefs; Students' concerns; University students,2666-1888,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_04431,"Cognitive and affective expectation of stigma, coping efficacy, and psychological distress among sexual minority people of color","There is a paucity of research on the potentially distinctive functions of cognitive and affective expectation of stigma. Moreover, expectation of stigma has received limited research attention with sexual minority people of color who may anticipate interlocking heterosexist and racist stigmatization. In this study, data from 209 sexual minority people of color were analyzed using path analysis and bootstrap procedures to test direct and indirect relations among perceived discrimination, expectation of stigma, coping self-efficacy, and psychological distress. Analyses disaggregated expectation of stigma into its cognitive (i.e., perceived likelihood of stigma) and affective (i.e., worry and anxiety about stigma) components. Results revealed that perceived discrimination had a unique direct link with psychological distress. In addition, perceived discrimination was linked indirectly with greater distress through affective expectation of stigma and problem-focused and emotion-focused coping self-efficacy. These findings suggest the importance of social justice interventions to reduce discrimination. Additionally, the findings suggest that interventions should attend to affective worry and anxiety about stigma and foster problem-focused and emotion-focused coping self-efficacy.

REC_04668,Blended knowledge sharing model in design professional,"Grounded in Nonaka and Takeuchi (Long Range Plan 54(4):102070, 2021) Socialization, Externalization, Combination, and Internalization (SECI) model, the present research develops a Blended Knowledge Sharing Activity (BKSA) model tailored for design practitioners, targeting the enhancement of learning outcomes and creativity. The investigation centers around the influence of BKSA on higher education students' learning achievements and creative potential, further delving into their application and performance relative to social media within design-related coursework. Employing a comprehensive methodological approach including sampling, t-tests, and structural equation modeling, questionnaires were disseminated to a cohort of 105 undergraduate students from two sophomore-level design classes. It is worth underscoring that despite the SECI model finding extensive applicability across numerous domains, its implementation within the context of design education remains comparatively underrepresented. This research lacuna served as a catalyst in our endeavor to apply the SECI model within knowledge-sharing activities specific to design majors, in anticipation of uncovering more potent strategies for learning and innovation. Our findings disclose a tangible positive correlation between BKSA and both the learning outcomes and creativity of undergraduate students. Moreover, the instrument we devised and utilized, acting as a robust measurement tool for the SECI model, provided additional validation for the beneficial influence of BKSA on university students' learning achievements and creative capacities. This novel insight not only redresses the underexplored application of the SECI model in design education but also furnishes a fresh theoretical vantage point for the amalgamation of blended learning and knowledge sharing paradigms.","Hu, JY; Lee, J; Yi, XH",2023,SCIENTIFIC REPORTS,10.1038/s41598-023-43505-z,13.0,1,nan-nan,English,,2045-2322,Article,WoS

Students completing the diary were enrolled in a compulsory class on social problem and policy analysis. The aim of introducing this innovative pedagogical tool into the course was to bridge the gaps among the theoretical-practical, research, and reflective dimensions in postgraduate social work education. Through completing this individual diary, students learnt how to analyze a specific social problem or policy in Hong Kong, especially its underlying causes, impacts, and solutions, which involves applying the academic scholarship to real-world contexts as well as undergoing deep reflection and critical enquiry. This study contributes to both the scholarship and practice of social work education in the university setting by empirically examining students' perceptions and experiences with pre- and post-course quantitative survey findings as well as qualitative reflective notes from student diary entries.

REC_05166,Emerging technologies and family: A cross-national study of family clinicians’ views,"Emerging technology adoption poses new challenges and opportunities to families and clinicians. Research that explores clinicians’ understanding and use of information-communication technologies; however, is still scarce. Our study, a replication of a cross-national study in four countries (Canada, Mexico, Spain, and the United States), investigated the relationship among clinicians’ use of and attitudes toward emerging technologies and their beliefs about technology’s impact on families in Turkey. We further inquired the relationship of two factors: the impact of emerging technology on the clinicians’ own families and the impact of cultural values on the attitudes toward technology use. The Turkish version of the modified Emerging Technologies and Families Survey was administered to family clinicians. The analytical strategy included a comparison of the data we collected in Turkey (n = 97) and the raw data from the original study (n = 258). We found significant cross-national differences in clinicians’ use of and attitudes toward information-communication technologies, and their assessments of families’ struggles with emerging technology. We analyzed the data vis-a-vis cultural differences and gave a special emphasis on implications for enhancing clinical practice. 1. Emerging technologies challenge families’ and family therapists’ assumptions about healthy family processes; attention to the self of the therapist at the intersection of cultural values is core in a sound assessment of families adopting emerging technologies. 2. Cultural humility and a curious stance may counteract the pervasive negative discourse about emerging technology adoption. 3. Empowering parents and couples to put technology in “its place” may ease the negative impact and enhance the positive influence of these technologies on families.

REC_05210,Perceptions among Dutch men who have sex with men and their willingness to use rectal microbicides and oral pre-exposure prophylaxis to reduce HIV risk—A preliminary study,"Oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretroviral (ARV) tablets and topical PrEP or microbicides containing ARV drugs could help to reduce HIV incidence. These methods hold promise for men who have sex with men (MSM) who are at higher risk of acquiring HIV. This mixed-methods study in the Netherlands explored perceptions of MSM and their willingness to use oral PrEP and rectal microbicides (RM) if made available. Recruited through social media (Facebook and Twitter), 108 MSM completed online questionnaires. Seven of them consented to discuss the survey results in semi-structured interviews. Survey participants preferred a RM that could be applied before and after anal intercourse (60.8%) to daily oral PrEP (20.3%). This preference was based on anticipated user friendliness, hypothetically fewer expected adverse events, and perceptions that RM would be less likely to be confused with ARVs for treatment. Those who preferred oral PrEP had stronger beliefs in the effectiveness of pills, perceived its use as easy, and viewed not requiring sexual partner awareness as advantages. No predictive factors were found for the choice of one prevention method over the other. Although Dutch MSM perceive both oral and topical PrEP positively, many barriers exist to the introduction of these products in the Netherlands. These include lack of regulatory approval of oral PrEP, no proven efficacy as yet for RM, and strong HIV stigma within the MSM population. In-depth qualitative research is needed to further explore the perceptions of MSM to inform implementation of programmes should these HIV prevention methods become available.

The present study used hierarchical multiple regression to investigate the demographic, clinical and psychological factors associated with SA following TBI. A sample of 85 people who experienced TBI were recruited through social media websites and brain injury services across the North-West of England. The overall combined biopsychosocial model was significant, explaining 52–54.3% of the variance in SA (across five imputations of missing data). The addition of psychological variables (self-esteem, locus of control, self-efficacy) made a significant contribution to the overall model, accounting for an additional 12.2–13% of variance in SA above that explained by demographic and clinical variables. Perceived stigma was the only significant independent predictor of SA (B = .274, p = .005). The findings suggest that psychological variables are important in the development of SA following TBI and must be considered alongside clinical factors. Furthermore, the significant role of stigma highlights the need for intervention at both an individualised and societal level.

We aimed to explore, in-depth, the problem of persistent pain in Australian community-dwelling adults with a spinal cord injury (SCI). Our objectives were to investigate (i) how individuals experience persistent pain, (ii) how they experience pain care and (iii) the concordance between clinical practice guidelines for managing pain and reported care practices. Methods: We conducted a mixed-methods convergent parallel study. Adults with SCI and persistent pain completed a survey (n = 43); a subset of participants completed interviews (n = 10). We analysed the data from each method separately and then integrated the findings. Results: Results indicated that the life impact of persistent pain is variable but it can be more disabling than physical impairments and compound a sense of isolation and despair. Community-based management was reported to predominantly have a pharmacological focus, with occurrences of opioid misuse apparent in the data. Access to expert, comprehensive and individualised care was frequently reported as inadequate. Conclusion: While some people with SCI and persistent pain can effectively self-manage their pain, for others the impact on quality of life is profound and complex care needs are commonly unmet.

REC_05320,Push and Pull Factors of Why Medical Students Want to Leave Türkiye: A Countrywide Multicenter Study,"Phenomenon: Physician immigration from other countries is increasing as developed countries continue to be desirable destinations for physicians; however, the determinants of Turkish physicians’ migration decisions are still unclear. Despite its wide coverage in the media and among physicians in Türkiye, and being the subject of much debate, there is insufficient data to justify this attention. With this study, we aimed to investigate the tendency of senior medical students in Türkiye to pursue their professional careers abroad and its related factors. Approach: This cross-sectional study involved 9881 senior medical students from 39 different medical schools in Türkiye in 2022. Besides participants’ migration decision, we evaluated the push and pull factors related to working, social environment and lifestyle in Türkiye and abroad, medical school education inadequacy, and personal insufficiencies, as well as the socioeconomic variables that may affect the decision to migrate abroad. The analyses were carried out with a participation rate of at least 50%. Findings: Of the medical students, 70.7% had emigration intentions. Approximately 60% of those want to stay abroad permanently, and 61.5% of them took initiatives such as learning a foreign language abroad (54.5%) and taking relevant exams (18.9%). Those who wanted to work in the field of Research & Development were 1.37 (95% CI: 1.22–1.54) times more likely to emigrate. The push factor that was related to emigration intention was the “working conditions in the country” (OR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.56–2.28) whereas the “social environment/lifestyle abroad” was the mere pull factor for the tendency of emigration (OR: 1.73, 95% CI: 1.45–2.06). In addition, the quality problem in medical schools also had a significant impact on students’ decisions (OR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.83–2.65). Insights: Although the percentage of those who want to emigrate “definitely” was at the same level as in the other developing countries, the tendency to migrate “permanently” was higher in Türkiye. Improving working conditions in the country and increasing the quality of medical faculties seem vital in preventing the migration of physicians. © 2023 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.","Eser, E.; Çil, E.; Sen Gundogan, N.E.; Çöl, M.; Yildirim-Öztürk, E.N.; Thomas, D.T.; Sünter, A.T.; Arslan, H.N.; Çitil, R.; Önder, Y.; Picakciefe, M.; Dede, B.; Demirel, C.; Aydin, N.; Çaǧlayan, C.; Aker, A.A.; Borlu, A.; Durmuş, H.; Can, G.; Siddikoglu, E.; Sumer, E.H.; Uygun, T.; Alkoy, S.; Aktas Aycan, K.; Koruk, İ.; Kuzan, R.; Demir, L.S.; Hacilar, E.; Sari, H.; Kılınç, Z.; Önal, O.; Dogan, E.; Emek, M.; Terzioglu, R.; Yapici, G.; Erdal, D.; Eser, S.; Ayhan Akman, E.; Koşan, Z.; Yilmaz, S.; Ayoǧlu, F.N.; Açıkgöz, B.; Musal, B.; Süner, A.F.; Erdoǧan, A.; Cilburunoglu, İ.; Saygun, M.; Daymaz, D.; Arslantaş, D.; Önsüz, M.F.; Beyhun, N.E.; Ustundag, M.G.; Ekuklu, G.; Ozder Tas, F.; Abacigil, F.; Öncü, S.; Hidiroǧlu, S.; Özaydin, A.N.; Pirinçci, E.; Bulut, I.; Tözün, M.; Eskiocak, M.; Günel, P.; Torun, S.D.; Yavuz, M.; Hasde, M.; Çamur, D.; Güneş, G.; Kurt, B.; Güler-Baysoy, N.; Bakirci, N.; Demir, F.; Çatak, B.; Özyurda, F.; Turan, M.",2024,Teaching and Learning in Medicine,10.1080/10401334.2023.2229810,36,5,588-600,English,career choice; emigration; immigration; Medical education; medical students,10401334,Article,Scopus
REC_05435,Exploring the impact of AI enhancement on the sports app community: Analyzing human-computer interaction and social factors using a hybrid SEM-ANN approach,"The iteration of AI technology has enhanced the industry competitiveness of sports apps and brought a new emotional experience to users. However, the community function of AI-enabled sports apps has not yet received sufficient attention. This study adopts the technology acceptance model framework through the human-computer interaction and social psychology perspectives, incorporating perceived interactivity (human-human interaction, human-information interaction, human-system interaction), user experience (functional experience, content experience, and emotional experience), attachment theory (emotional attachment, emotional loyalty), social identity, social trust, and satisfaction variables to construct a theoretical model. It aims to solve the problem of how AI can enhance users’ emotional interaction, community stickiness, and ultimately social interaction satisfaction in sports apps. Through literature review, theoretical analysis, and case study, the Chinese “KEEP” APP was identified as the research object, and the questionnaire was constructed with an improved test scale. The study used a cross-sectional sampling method to collect data from Chinese online platforms for three months (N = 520) and tested the hypotheses in the theoretical model through structural equation modeling and artificial neural networks. The results of the study show that (1) emotional attachment, emotional loyalty, social identity, and social trust positively and significantly affect user satisfaction; (2) emotional attachment and social identity positively and significantly affect human-human interaction; (3) perceived usefulness, social identity, and social trust significantly construct an influence loop on the internal path. Compared with existing studies, this study proposes a multidimensional innovative framework that reveals the deeper influence mechanism of AI technology in sports APP communities and makes up for the shortcomings of existing studies in terms of users’ emotional interactions and community stickiness. Through this study, sports APP developers and operators, marketers, AI technology developers, as well as sports enthusiasts, and general users can obtain specific practical suggestions to further optimize the design and functionality of sports apps, and enhance the overall user experience and satisfaction.

Where this study differs is the examination into the importance of the system functionality of online environments and its relationship to germane cognitive load and collaboration. The research was performed using surveys of students who were studying at the Open Cyber University of Korea. The study found that the relationship between collaborative interaction and germane load was stronger when system functionality is high. It also supported existing evidence that well-designed online systems with high functionality benefit learners, as students who are in classes with higher quality systems report higher levels of germane cognitive load.

REC_05758,The relationship between personality traits and coping strategies with permanence in the treatment process in patients undergoing methadone maintenance treatment,"Background The increasing tendency to use drugs, especially with the lowering of the age of addiction and its prevalence among young people, is one of the major social problems, and many efforts have been made to investigate the relationship between drug use and personality structures.MethodsThis cross-sectional study was conducted in 2020–2022 on opioid-addicted men who were referred to an addiction treatment clinic undergoing maintenance treatment with methadone for at least 6 months. Demographic information, the NEO personality characteristics questionnaire, and Lazarus’s coping strategies were completed by the patients.Results150 patients with an average age of 36.78 ± 9.03 years were investigated. The results showed that the score of the personality dimension of conscientiousness had a significant relationship with the rate of persistence in treatment (P-value < .05). The score of accepting responsibility had a significant inverse relationship with the rate of persistence in treatment (P-value < .05). However, other components of personality traits and coping strategies didn’t have a significant relationship with the rate of persistence in treatment (P-value > .05).ConclusionDifferent personality dimensions and different levels of self-efficacy and the choice and pattern of coping style are effective factors in the tendency or non-tendency of people to use drugs and addiction.

REC_05788,How do longitudinal clerkships in general practice/primary care impact on student experience and career intention? A cross-sectional study of student experience,"Introduction Internationally, the amount of time that medical students spend in community settings has increased in recent years. 'Longitudinal clerkships', which involve a prolonged exposure, are now common. In Ireland, medical education policy has promoted community-based education across medical schools, including one with a longitudinal clerkship of one semester duration. Aims To examine medical students' experience of a longitudinal clerkship in general practice/primary care, its impact on career preference and the factors which students find most important in supporting their learning. Methods Quantitative cross-sectional study of students who had recently completed a longitudinal clerkship at the Graduate-Entry Medical School at University of Limerick involving an online survey. Results Most students agreed the intended learning outcomes of the clerkship had been achieved. Activity such as two-way feedback with GP tutors, assisting with procedural skills and parallel consulting were rated as of greatest educational value. Students identified internet access, a safe/unthreatening learning environment, and feeling part of the clinical team as the practice attributes most important in supporting their learning. Twenty-six (41%) intended to pursue a career in general practice/primary care and 46 (72%) indicated they were more likely to pursue a career in general practice/primary care after the clerkship. The clerkship was a positive influence on career intentions, with 63% of those who indicated that general practice/primary care was not their current preferred career option reporting they were significantly more likely to pursue this option after the clerkship (chi(2) = 3.52, P < 0.05). Conclusion Our findings indicate that longitudinal clerkships are effective in helping students to achieve their intended learning outcomes and identify the student activity and practice attributes that are most important in promoting their learning.","O'Donoghue, S; McGrath, D; Cullen, W",2015,EDUCATION FOR PRIMARY CARE,10.1080/14739879.2015.11494336,26.0,3,166-175,English,active learning; family medicine; general practice careers; longitudinal clerkships; primary care; undergraduate medical education,1473-9879,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_06158,Barriers to treatment as prevention adoption among sexual and gender minority individuals who have sex with men in the United States,"The discovery that people with an undetectable HIV viral load are unable to transmit the virus to sex partners (U = U) has ushered in a new era in HIV care. As a result of this discovery, treatment as prevention (TasP) has become a powerful tool toward ending the epidemic. However, despite its sound scientific basis, many communities affected by HIV face barriers toward adopting TasP as a complete HIV prevention strategy. In addition, most research to date has only focused on TasP in the context of committed monogamous partnerships. To identify barriers to TasP adoption among some of those most affected by HIV, we conducted in-depth qualitative interviews with 62 sexual and gender minority individuals of varying serostatuses. Participants were identified from the results of an online survey, where those who indicated at least some awareness of TasP were invited to partake in a follow-up interview. Interviews were thematically coded to identify emergent themes relating to TasP adoption. Seven primary barriers emerged from data analysis pertaining to TasP science, internalized beliefs about HIV safety, and interactional dynamics between partners: (1) unfamiliarity with TasP science, (2) perceived limitations of TasP science, (3) difficulty changing understanding of “safe sex,” (4) unwillingness to rely on partners' reports of being undetectable, (5) persistent HIV stigma, (6) less difficulty finding serosimilar partners, and (7) difficulty incorporating TasP into casual encounters. Together, these barriers confirm the existing findings about TasP adoption, and extend the literature by identifying barriers beyond a lack of education and outside of monogamous contexts.

REC_06208,"m-Health: A Critical Analysis of Awareness, Perception, and Attitude of Healthcare Among Providers in Himachal Pradesh, North India","Introduction: Providing healthcare in remote mountainous areas is challenging. The increasing availability of mobile connectivity needs to be exploited by offering healthcare through a mobile medium, popularly known as mobile health (m-health). It is essential to understand the awareness, perception, and attitude of healthcare providers (HCPs) in deploying m-health. Their outlook on new technologies influences patient adoption. Reports on attitudes regarding healthcare through mobile phones are now confined to views from the recipient. Materials and Methods: This study from August 1 to September 30, 2014 analyzed the views of 592 HCPs (12.3% of all HCPs) in Himachal Pradesh, India. They included faculty and students of the two medical colleges, as well as HCPs from all of the 12 districts. Results: Although Himachal Pradesh has the highest teledensity of all states in India (117.6%), only 58.8% of HCPs (of those surveyed, 72% lived in suburban areas and 24.8% in Shimla, the state capital) would easily recommend m-health. Self-perceived ability to use mobile services was 85%. Fifty-nine percent used mobile devices for social networking, and 52.4% used Wi-Fi. Sixty-one percent of those interviewed were females, and 39% were males. Conclusions: The transformative potential of m-health hinges on its acceptance and use by all stakeholders. The study suggests that as HCPs in Himachal Pradesh are already using mobile value added services and are highly information technology literate, addressing their specific concerns could lead to use of m-health in Himachal Pradesh. Healthcare delivery in Himachal Pradesh is still suboptimal. With increasing connectivity, awareness, and commencement of telemedicine services in Himachal Pradesh, m-health has the potential to be a reality.","Ganapathy, K; Kanwar, V; Bhatnagar, T; Uthayakumaran, N",2016,TELEMEDICINE AND E-HEALTH,10.1089/tmj.2015.0198,22.0,8,675-688,English,mobile health; telemedicine; telehealth; telecommunications,1530-5627,Article,WoS
REC_06322,Leadership Training in Medicine-12 Years of Experience From the Feagin Leadership Program,"Introduction Increasingly, physicians find themselves in demanding leadership positions. However, leadership education for medical trainees remains lacking with most physicians reporting that they are ill-equipped to tackle the challenges of leadership. Here, we set out to describe the Feagin Leadership Program (FLP) and assess its reception and impact on trainees over the past 12 years. Materials and Methods During the 1-year FLP, selected scholars from Duke University, Wake Forest University, and the University of North Carolina participate in five leadership sessions, individual coaching, a leadership forum, and a multidisciplinary team-based capstone project. A 28-question survey with six optional free-response questions was distributed to the Feagin Alumni Network, and descriptive statistics were assessed. Results Since its founding, 212 scholars have graduated from the FLP and 117 (55%) alumni have gone on to surgical specialties. A survey was distributed among all Feagin alumni. A total of 56 (26%) surveys were completed. Forty-three percent (n = 24) had held at least one leadership position since completing the FLP. When asked about the impact of their experience, 96% (n = 54) said that the program encouraged them to pursue a position of leadership within their field, 95% (n = 53) stated that it prepared them for such a position, and 93% (n = 52) stated that the program positively influenced their decision to be involved with current or future positions of leadership. Conclusions Over the last 12 years, the FLP has demonstrated a high perceived impact on personal growth, leadership proficiency, and the decision to pursue leadership positions in medicine. The current dearth of leadership education for surgical trainees can best be addressed with models such as the FLP, with adoption benefiting medical trainees, the medical community, and patients they serve.","Nosé, B; Sankey, E; Moris, D; Doty, J; Taylor, D",2023,MILITARY MEDICINE,10.1093/milmed/usab293,188.0,3-4,E510-E515,English,,0026-4075,Article,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO
REC_06411,Assessment of Ileostomy Output Using Telemedicine: A Feasibility Trial,"BACKGROUND: Ileostomies are a routine part of the care of patients with rectal cancer, but are associated with significant risk for dehydration, readmission, and acute kidney injury. Telemedicine has proven beneficial in decreasing readmission in chronic medical illnesses, but its utility in patients with an ileostomy is not well studied. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the feasibility of televideoconferencing in the assessment of ileostomy output. DESIGN: An institutional review board-approved, prospective clinical trial was conducted at a single institution from November 2014 through December 2015. SETTINGS: The study was conducted in a single, large academic medical center. PATIENTS: Patients >18 years of age undergoing surgery with plans for ileostomy were eligible. INTERVENTIONS: Televideoconference assessments of ileostomy output and the need for medical intervention were conducted during the postoperative stay and compared with in-person assessment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary end point of the trial was the feasibility of using teleconferencing to assess the need for medical intervention, defined as 90% agreement between telemedicine and in-person assessments. Secondary end points included patient/provider satisfaction, and correlative studies examined dehydration events and readmission. RESULTS: Twenty-seven patients underwent 44 teleconferencing assessments of ileostomy output. Compared with in-person treatment decisions, there was a 95% match (95% CI, 85%-99%). The readmission rate for the study participants was 31%, and 18% experienced dehydration events. Both patients and faculty responded favorably to surveys regarding the use of telemedicine in the perioperative period. LIMITATIONS: The study is limited by its in-hospital use of technology and small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: Televideoconference evaluation is a feasible, reliable means of assessing ileostomy output with high patient and physician acceptance. Our pilot study provides rationale for further study in the postdischarge setting for patients with ileostomies. The incorporation of televideoconference assessment within a teledischarge program may enable early intervention to improve patient outcomes.

The authors discussed the results from statistical analysis further through the lens of the loss aversion theory.FindingsThe authors found that loss aversion, represented by higher income that translates to greater potential pain caused by losing things to be the most significant demographic factor behind 2FA adoption. On the contrary, those with a low-income background, even if they have some college degree, are more likely to skip 2FA despite their awareness of this technology. The authors also found that the older generation, particularly females, to be among the most vulnerable groups when it comes to authentication-based cyber threats as they are much less likely to adopt 2FA, or even to be aware of its existence in the first place.Originality/valueAuthentication is one of the most important topics in cybersecurity that is related to human-computer interaction. While 2FA increases the security level of authentication methods, it also requires extra efforts that can translate to some level of inconvenience on the user's end. By identifying the associated factors from the user's ends, a necessary intervention can be made so that more users are willing to jump on the 2FA adopters' train.","Pratama, AR; Firmansyah, FM",2025,APPLIED COMPUTING AND INFORMATICS,10.1108/ACI-12-2020-0156,21.0,1/2,53-64,English,Two-factor authentication; Awareness; Adoption; Loss aversion; Demographics factors; Vulnerable groups,2634-1964,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_06688,Assessing internship learning performance and its predictors: moderation of learning climate,"PurposeThis research aims to elucidate the complex relationships among internship learning performance, problem-solving efficacy, and their determinants by simultaneously examining a key variable that may moderate these relationships.Design/methodology/approachThis study carried out its empirical examination by surveying graduate students at a prestigious university in Taiwan. The investigation selected two programs from the College of Management and another two from the College of Engineering within the university through a random sampling approach. The selection of research participants from the domains of management and engineering is well-suited to this study's objectives, given the pronounced prevalence of internships in these fields. Of the 280 questionnaires, 234 usable questionnaires were finally collected for a response rate of 83.57%.FindingsThe findings of this study show that learning goal orientation and communication skill learning both represent critical motivations that directly dominate the growth of problem-solving efficacy to ultimately boost learning performance. At the same time, the positive moderation of learning climate suggests the learning climate as an accelerator for learning autonomy that boosts interns' problem-solving efficacy more strongly.Originality/valueThis study presents an expansion of the social learning theory's conventional focus on general self-efficacy beliefs by delving into the realm of internships as a unique research context to explore problem-solving efficacy as a distinct facet of self-efficacy. Within this context, the study integrates the mediating role of problem-solving efficacy into the learning dynamics of internships, where interns engage in both learning goal orientation and communication skill learning.

REC_06958,Exploring the drivers and consequences of the “awe” emotion in outdoor sports – a study using the latest partial least squares structural equation modeling technique and necessary condition analysis,"Purpose: Awe is an essential post-experience assessment; nevertheless, few studies have discussed its role in the field of outdoor sports or outdoor sports tourism. In this study, the authors aim to examine the effects of awe on participants' satisfaction and behavioral intention by considering the perceived vastness of the natural environment, perceived professionalism, and self-image congruity as drivers. Design/methodology/approach: The authors proposed and empirically tested a research model based on a survey with 480 responses collected in China. The effect of awe is explored from the perspectives of both sufficiency logic and necessity logic by applying the combined use of partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) and necessary condition analysis (NCA). Findings: The results show that the perceived vastness of the natural environment, perceived professionalism and self-image congruity are sufficient conditions for awe: these factors affect awe positively, which, in turn, positively affect satisfaction and behavioral intention. Furthermore, both the perceived vastness of the natural environment and perceived professionalism represent a necessary condition for awe. Awe acts as a necessary and sufficient condition for both participants' satisfaction and behavioral intention. Practical implications: The results of this study suggest that the generation of awe can be used as a business strategy to influence outdoor sports participants' choices in practice. In addition to the unique natural environment, professional exercising and self-realization are key success factors in enhancing the positive evaluations of outdoor sports participants. Originality/value: This study is a first attempt to identify the role of awe in outdoor sports activities. Methodologically, it provides a paradigm for the combined use of PLS-SEM and NCA in sports management research by identifying the necessary and sufficient effects of awe on outdoor sports participants' post-experience evaluation.

REC_06975,Gaining legitimacy and host market acceptance: A CRM analysis for foreign subsidiaries in China,"Purpose: Building on the scant literature on how foreign subsidiaries strategize Cause-Related-Marketing (CRM) to gain legitimacy and acceptance in host markets, this paper investigated the impact of two CRM components (post-crisis recovery, CSR activities) on subsidiary performance and future opportunities in China, a country whose institutional development lags behind its economic achievements. The study also investigated the moderating effects of strategic mindset and subsidiary empowerment on CRM effects, issues highly relevant to MNCs and their subsidiaries. Design/methodology/approach: To minimize common method variance, the study adopted a multi-informant firm executive survey design that included responses from a director and a manager from 230 foreign subsidiaries operating in China. The director-level respondents assessed Firm Competences, Organizational Ties, Subsidiary Performance and Future Opportunities. The manager-level respondents assessed CSR activities (Legal, Ethical and Philanthropic CSR) and other operational measures. Findings: The two CRM components affected Subsidiary Performance (sales, shares and profit) and Future Opportunities in different ways as postulated by legitimacy theory. While Post-crisis Recovery enhanced Subsidiary Performance (sales), it could not enhance Future Opportunities by itself unless the subsidiary received headquarters empowerment. Interestingly, only Ethical and Philanthropic CSR activities with enhancement from Strategic Mindset mattered to Future Opportunities. Originality/value: The research unfolded key elements in how foreign subsidiaries planned CRM strategies to gain legitimacy and acceptance in a host market with less-developed institutions, thereby addressing a gap in the literature. It also showed how firms internalize CRM and became receptive to social sentiments of a significant host market.

REC_07054,Exploring factors influencing educators' adoption of ChatGPT: a mixed method approach,"PurposeA number of recent artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled technologies, including summarisers, paraphrasers and the cutting-edge chatbots not only have outstanding potentials in modern educational systems but also could lead to a dramatic paradigm shift in the whole education process. This study aims to explore the factors that shape the academic community's desire and intention to use AI conversational chatbot technology, with a particular focus on the leading ChatGPT.Design/methodology/approachThis study uses a mixed method approach to explore the educators' adoption of chatbots through an empirically validated model. The model, known as the Educators' Adoption of ChatGPT, was developed by integrating the theoretical foundations of both the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology and Status Quo Bias (SQB) frameworks, as well as insights gathered from interviews. The relationships within this model were then tested using a quantitative approach. The partial least squares-structural equation modelling method was used to analyse 243 valid survey responses.FindingsThe outcomes of the analysis indicated that perceived educators' effort expectancy, educators' autonomous motivation, perceived learners' AI competency, perceived educators' competency, innovative behaviour towards technological agility and perceived students' engagement are significant determinants of educators' intention to use chatbots. In contrast, perceived unfair evaluation of students, perceived students' overreliance and perceived bias/inaccuracies were shown to have significant impacts on the resistance to use the technology, which typically implies a negatively significant influence on the educators' use intention. Interestingly, perceived fraudulent use of ChatGPT was proven insignificant on the resistance to use chatbots.Originality/valueThis study makes a significant contribution to the field of educational technology by filling the gap in research on the use and acceptance of AI-enabled assistants in education.

REC_07108,Attitude and behavioral intention for using metaverse in education: learner's perspective,"PurposeThis study aims to understand and analyze the aspects influencing students' attitudes and behavior toward the use of metaverse in education. The metaverse is currently viewed as technology with immense prospects. However, the practice of the metaverse for educational motives is rarely deliberated.Design/methodology/approachTo assess the effect of the metaverse on students' knowledge and use of resources, general interests and attitudes toward the metaverse in education, a survey was conducted. The collected data were analyzed using a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) in the first phase to address the various validity parameters. In the second phase, path analysis of the model was performed using structural equation modeling (SEM).FindingsThe study investigated how students intended to behave while using the metaverse for learning. The attitude toward adopting metaverse as technology is influenced by perceived utility and simplicity of use. This leads to behavioral intention as well. Studies reveal that the aspect of perceived usefulness is considered to be more significant in assessing the intention of use.Research limitations/implicationsThis quantitative study contributes to the literature on metaverse, which is in the growing stage. In the educational sector, the existing studies are scarce; hence, the addition to the literature on metaverse is quite significant in the education domain.Practical implicationsThe study benefits the students and the academicians because metaverse is largely considered an integral part of technology platforms, which has to be included in the learning systems eventually. There are few courses where the use of metaverse is already initiated at an introductory level, thus opening a broad spectrum of opportunities at all levels. It can provide scholars access to a massive array of resources, including multimedia presentations, interactive objects that support the delivery of lessons, videos, images and audio recordings.Originality/valueThis study adds to the existing literature by examining the impact of metaverse in education.

Design/methodology/approach – Grounded in Source Credibility Theory, the Elaboration Likelihood Model and Parasocial Interaction Theory, this study used a cross-sectional survey with purposive sampling of 800 students aged 18–28 years (460 BA; 340 Master’s). Established scales (five-point Likert; back-translated to Arabic) were validated via confirmatory factor analysis and tested in a structural model estimated in JASP 0.19.3. Findings – The measurement model showed excellent fit. Structural equation modeling results indicate all predictors positively affect purchase intention, with the largest effects for physical attractiveness and PSI, followed by informativeness and trust in the influencer. Trustworthiness and expertise offered smaller but positive contributions. The findings of this study support a dual-process account in which affective–relational cues and diagnostic information jointly drive intention on a highly visual platform. Research limitations/implications – This study is limited by its cross-sectional design, reliance on intention rather than behavior and use of non-probability sampling, which may affect generalizability. Practical implications – Brands should prioritize creators with natural brand–creator match-up and strong community bonds. Strategies should pair aesthetic appeal with decision-useful content while safeguarding authenticity through transparent disclosure. Originality/value – This research provides one of the first large-sample tests of an integrated influencer-effects model among Lebanese Gen Z, offering insights into how credibility, attractiveness and parasocial dynamics jointly shape purchase intentions. Beyond documenting effects in a new context, this study refines existing theories by showing that affective–relational cues (attractiveness and PSI) systematically dominate classic credibility facets even when modeled jointly and by locating this hierarchy in a crisis-affected Middle-Eastern setting, thereby clarifying boundary conditions for credibility and parasocial theories in social commerce. © 2026 Emerald Publishing Limited","Azouri, M.",2025,Journal of Enterprising Communities,10.1108/JEC-09-2025-0320,,,1-19,English,Attractiveness; Credibility; Generation Z; Influencer marketing; Instagram; Parasocial interaction; Purchase intention; Trust,17506204,Article,Scopus
REC_07606,Ethical Concerns With Regards to Artificial Intelligence: A National Public Poll in Taiwan,"Ethical concerns about how artificial intelligence (AI) impacts individuals and society are increasing rapidly, but few studies have systematically investigated the public awareness of AI ethics. This research collected and analyzed data from a public poll in Taiwan, an Asian region with a developed economy and specific social conditions, to identify societal views on AI ethics. The analysis of 84 AI ethics guidelines worldwide provided the survey framework covering five ethical principles: transparency, fairness, privacy, nonmaleficence, and accountability. The overarching goal was to determine the commonalities and differences in the ethical concerns of Taiwanese laypersons toward AI. Participants aged from 20 to 70 ( $N =1$ ,200) completed a computer-assisted random-digit-dial telephone survey, which utilized ethical scenarios to capture social views, and item validity was confirmed using focus-group interviews. Results found that respondents concerned about nonmaleficence the most, emphasizing that AI applications should not harm humans. Taiwanese people therefore tended to support strict AI technology regulation. It was particularly interesting that different patterns of public concern emerged about accountability, with the opinions on attributing responsibility to stakeholders varying with scenarios and the public’s backgrounds. Those with higher education levels tended to attribute more responsibility to the industry, whereas those who had only received elementary-school education attributed accountability to AI developers. For self-driving cars, accountability was attributed to AI developers, whereas for medical decision-making, the accountability was attributed to the hospitals. These findings may help to elucidate the associations between societal views and the ethical principles of AI worldwide.",W. Li-Yun Chang; S. -Y. Liu; Y. -K. Liao; T. S. -H.

REC_07616,The Influence of Social Support Theory on AI Acceptance: Examining Educational Support and Perceived Usefulness Using SEM Analysis,"This study investigates factors influencing the acceptance of artificial intelligence (AI) in education, focusing on attitudes and intentions toward its use. Drawing on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Social Support Theory (SST), the research examines perceived usefulness, ease of use, and support measures, including educational and emotional support. The study was conducted at King Saud University, where it adopted a quantitative approach, collecting data from 350 participants through a structured survey. A final sample of 308 valid responses was analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM). The findings revealed significant relationships between key constructs: perceived educational support positively influenced perceived usefulness ( beta=0.160 , p = 0.000) and attitudes toward AI ( beta=0.140 , p = 0.010). Perceived usefulness ( beta=0.670 , p = 0.000) and ease of use ( beta=0.330 , p = 0.000) were strong predictors of positive attitudes, which, in turn, significantly shaped intentions to use AI ( beta=0.760 , p = 0.000). Emotional support and cognitive support also had notable but mixed effects on perceived usefulness. However, social interaction support and perceived enjoyment did not demonstrate significant influence. These findings highlight the importance of designing AI systems that emphasise usability and provide robust educational and emotional support to enhance acceptance. The study contributes to theory by extending TAM with constructs from SST, offering new insights into AI adoption in academic contexts. Practically, the results guide policymakers and developers in fostering AI acceptance by addressing educational and emotional needs, ensuring effective implementation in higher education.","Aldraiweesh, AA; Alturki, U",2025,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3534099,13.0,,18366-18385,English,Artificial intelligence; social support theory; social support theory; AI adoption frameworks; AI adoption frameworks; TAM; TAM; educational AI; educational AI,2169-3536,Article,WoS; Scopus; IEEE
REC_07623,"Improving Learning Management System Performance: A Comprehensive Approach to Engagement, Trust, and Adaptive Learning","This paper examines the critical factors influencing the performance of Learning Management Systems (LMS), emphasizing user satisfaction and loyalty. Employing a quantitative approach, structural equation modeling (SEM) was used to analyze survey data from 266 university students actively utilizing LMS platforms. Findings reveal that system quality significantly impacts user satisfaction, emphasizing reliability and usability. Adaptive learning enhances satisfaction and engagement by tailoring educational content to individual needs. Trust, particularly regarding data security and system reliability, further contributes to satisfaction, underscoring the necessity of robust and transparent security measures. Although information quality positively affects user satisfaction, it is less impactful than system-related factors. Service quality, while exerting a smaller influence, highlights the importance of responsive technical support for overall functionality. Additionally, user satisfaction strongly predicts user loyalty, indicating that satisfied users are more likely to continue using and recommending LMS platforms. The study provides actionable insights for developers and educators, advocating for enhanced system performance, adaptive learning tools, and trust-building measures to foster satisfaction and loyalty.","Almusfar, LA",2025,IEEE ACCESS,10.1109/ACCESS.2025.3550288,13.0,,46408-46425,English,Learning management systems; Education; Mathematical models; Adaptation models; Reliability; Hybrid learning; Analytical models; Adaptive learning; Usability; System performance; Learning management system (LMS); user engagement (UE); trust (T); adaptive learning (AL); system quality (SQ); information quality (IQ); service quality (SeQ); user satisfaction (US); user loyalty (UsL); structural equation modeling (SEM); personalized learning; higher education,2169-3536,Article,WoS; IEEE
REC_07676,Predicting Postgraduate Student Engagement Using Artificial Intelligence (AI),"The increasing number of international students (IS) enrolled in Australian higher education institutions, combined with the widespread adoption of online and hybrid learning, has significant implications for understanding the factors that influence engagement among this diverse student group. Early identification of students with low engagement facilitates academic success, prevents poor outcomes, optimizes resource allocation, improves teaching strategies, increases motivation, and supports long-term success. This study's main aim is to examine the use of AI to predict student engagement. Development of a theoretically informed survey that aimed to elicit postgraduate students' engagement was developed and validated by expert judgment. In total, 200 copies of the survey were distributed, 121 responses were received, and 96 were considered for this study representing a response rate of 48%. This study promotes a multidimensional approach, utilizing AI and ML methodologies, to determine the influence of social and cultural contexts on student engagement. This approach enables educators and institutions to create effective strategies for enhancing the learning experience of postgraduate students. Multiple AI and ML techniques have been utilized including synthetic data generation methods such GaussianCopula, triplet-based variational autoencoder, generative adversarial networks, CopulaGAN, and conditional tabular generative adversarial network. These techniques are specifically employed to predict various dimensions of engagement, including personal, academic, intellectual, social, and professional engagement. The performance of AI/ML algorithms, including support vector machine, K-nearest neighbors, decision trees, gradient boosting machine, random forest, Naive Bayes, logistic regression, and extra trees, was assessed using several metrics including F1 score, sensitivity, specificity, confusion matrix, and accuracy. The models used in this study achieved up to 85% accuracy, offering a solid foundation for guidelines and support to enhance decision making processes in higher education. These findings provide valuable insights for both academics and policy makers, laying the groundwork for evidence-based strategies to improve student engagement. © 2020 IEEE.","Shafiabady, N.; Koo, T.; Ud Din, F.U.; Sattarshetty, K.; Yen, M.; Alazab, M.; Alsharaydeh, E.",2025,IEEE Transactions on Artificial Intelligence,10.1109/TAI.2025.3548016,6,9,2464-2475,English,Artificial intelligence (AI); decision trees (DT); extra trees (ET); gradient boosting machine (GBM); international students (IS); K-nearest neighbors (KNN); logistic regression (LR); Naive Bayes (NB); random forest (RF); student engagement; support vector machine (SVM); synthetic data generation,,Article,Scopus; IEEE
REC_07937,Stigma by association among alcohol and other drug and harm reduction workers: Implications for workplace outcomes,"Introduction The negative attitudes people hold towards those who use alcohol or other drugs (AOD) can also affect the people who work with this community, leading to lowered productivity and wellbeing. The impact of this stigma by association in the AOD and harm reduction sector is particularly significant because workers may have lived experience of AOD use and identify strongly with their client group. This study aimed to examine how stigma by association among health workers in the AOD/harm reduction sector relates to workplace outcomes. A secondary aim was to explore how lived experience influences experiences of stigma by association. Methods The research used a cross‐sectional survey design and data collection occurred in 2023. Australian AOD/harm reduction workers (n = 228) completed an online survey assessing stigma by association as well as various workplace outcomes measures. Results Participants who reported experiencing more stigma by association experienced poorer workplace wellbeing, higher burnout and greater intentions to leave the AOD/harm reduction field. Experiences of stigma by association were unrelated to job satisfaction. Additional analyses revealed that participants with lived experience reported higher levels of job satisfaction and lowered intentions to leave the sector, but findings of stigma by association and its impacts on workplace outcomes did not differ from those without lived experience. Discussion and Conclusions Identifying staff experiences of stigma by association and developing support and advocacy mechanisms to address this is likely to be key to reducing these experiences and ultimately to increasing positive workplace outcomes for AOD and harm reduction staff.

REC_08230,Health empowerment among immigrant women in transnational marriages in Taiwan,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to develop, implement, and evaluate a theory‐based intervention designed to promote increased health empowerment for marriage migrant women in Taiwan. The rapid increase of international marriage immigration through matchmaking agencies has received great attention recently because of its impact on social and public health issues in the receiving countries. Design and Methods: A participatory action research (PAR) and in‐depth interviews were adopted. Sixty‐eight women participated in this study. Eight workshops of the health empowerment project were completed. Findings: Through a PAR‐based project, participants received positive outcomes. Four outcome themes were identified: (a) increasing health literacy, (b) facilitating capacity to build social networks, (c) enhancing sense of self‐worth, and (d) building psychological resilience. Conclusions: PAR was a helpful strategy that enabled disadvantaged migrant women to increase their health literacy, psychological and social health, and well‐being. Clinical Relevance: The findings can be referenced by the government in making health‐promoting policies for Southeast Asian immigrant women to increase their well‐being. Community health nurses can apply PAR strategies to plan and design health promotion intervention for disadvantaged migrant women.

REC_08398,Community‐based multiple screening for metabolic syndrome by innovative theory: A longitudinal study,"The purpose of this research is to elucidate whether metabolic syndrome affects the rate of adoption of a new multiple cancer screening programme, based on the Diffusion of Innovation theory. The time to attend the screening programme, conducted in Keelung, Taiwan, within 10 years was assessed by innovativeness (innovators, early adaptors, early majority, late majority and laggard) using data from 79,303 residents, with the information on metabolic syndrome accrued from routine adult health check‐ups. The median time of adopting the programme and the relative rates of early adoption by metabolic syndrome and its severity score were estimated. The results show that the estimated times to adopt the programme ranged from 3 months for innovators to 10 years for the laggard. The rate of early adoption was 34% higher for participants without metabolic syndrome than for those with the disease, and the gradient relationship of disease severity was noted. The adjusted median time to adopt innovativeness was 0.82 years earlier for participants who were disease‐free than those with the disease. Meanwhile, the adjusted median time was wider by up to 2.25 years for those with severe disease. The study suggests that innovation should prioritise the potential risk of the metabolic syndrome population.

REC_08664,RETRACTED: Exploring the Entrepreneurship Training Mode of Medical Students in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Universities under the Strategic Background of Healthy China from the Perspective of Mixed Big Data (Retracted Article),"In order to solve the problem that postgraduates are affected by the traditional concept of career choice of the native family and their entrepreneurial intention is obviously low, a method to explore the entrepreneurial spirit training model of medical students in Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei colleges and universities from the perspective of mixed big data is proposed. This article chooses to conduct research by conducting a survey on the entrepreneurial willingness of postgraduates in universities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei and its influencing factors. From the perspective of master students from five universities in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, the selection of personal background information, entrepreneurial attitude, subjective norms, perceived behavior control, and entrepreneurship education index factors establish the index system of the influencing factors of graduate students' entrepreneurial intention and use the TPB theoretical model and SPSS data statistics and other tools to analyze the obtained data results. The results show that gender, major, place of origin, part-time experience, and entrepreneurial experience of relatives and friends correspond to 0.000, 0.000, 0.482, 0.172, 0.003, and 0.004, respectively. It can be seen that the independent variables, major and place of origin, have no statistical significance. In the statistics of college students' willingness to start a business, 23.33% of the students said nothing at all, and 27.8% of the students said thought, but would not start a business. It can be seen that entrepreneurial attitude, subjective norm, and perceived behavioral control all positively affect entrepreneurial willingness, and only learning ability, opportunity grasping ability, self-recognition ability, and decisiveness have a significant effect on entrepreneurial willingness.","Gong, L; Wang, C; Bai, JT",2022,MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS,10.1155/2022/8177760,2022.0,,nan-nan,English,,1574-017X,Article; Retracted Publication,WoS; Scopus
REC_08829,"Exploring relationships between K–12 music educators’ demographics, perceptions of intrapreneuring, and motivation at work","Gifford Pinchot III coined the term intrapreneur to recognize “dreamers who do”: individuals who transform ideas into new endeavors within existing organizations. The purpose of this study was to gauge the salience of intrapreneuring for K–12 music teachers and examine how its attributes and behaviors relate to teachers’ workplace motivation and demographics. From a sampling frame of 1,351 public school music teachers in New York State, 576 teachers completed an online questionnaire for a response rate of 42.6%. Results showed statistically significant differences in teachers’ intrapreneurial orientation depending on teaching experience, level and specialization of teaching position, and school affluence. Higher levels of confidence in and contextual support for intrapreneuring predicted stronger teacher motivation. Respondents who self-identified as intrapreneurs facilitated collaborations between their students and guest musicians, piloted new approaches for teaching creativity and improvisation, and developed innovative curricula. While respondents generally felt autonomous, they did not feel they had adequate resources for launching new endeavors, and they perceived low levels of tolerance for risk and mistakes within their school organizations. Findings of this study may help isolate specific intrapreneurial attributes and organizational factors that could support teacher-driven pedagogy and reduce teacher demotivation and attrition.

REC_08876,"Using factorial survey experiments to measure attitudes, social norms, and fairness concerns in developing countries","Survey-based experimental methods are increasingly used in the social sciences to study, among others, attitudes, norms, and fairness judgments. One of these methods is the factorial survey experiment (FSE or vignette experiment) in which respondents are confronted with various descriptions of situations that differ in a discrete number of attributes (or factors), and they are asked to evaluate those situations according to criteria such as agreement, approval, and fairness. Due to the systematic experimental variation of the presented situations, an FSE can separate effects of single situational attributes, allowing the causal influence of relevant situational attributes to be determined. This is the key advantage over simple survey items. While most studies using FSEs are carried out in developed countries in which respondents are familiar with surveys, we add further evidence that this method can also unfold its power in a developing context. Building on previous applications of FSEs in Africa, we demonstrate the usefulness of this method in four novel studies on social norms regarding the physical punishment of children and the social approval of technology adoption in Benin as well as judgments of just earnings in Rwanda. We also test for the first time the applicability of multiple vignettes per respondents in a Global South/remote area context. The results of these studies are theoretically meaningful and the overwhelming majority of respondents discriminate between vignettes. This supports the validity of FSEs. However, conducting survey experiments in developing countries is different from similar experimental research in developed countries and, therefore, we also discuss some of these differences and corresponding challenges. Last but not least, our article shows, provided a few precautions are heeded, that FSEs could be used as a vehicle to innovate social science research in a Global South/remote area context.

It was found that many researchers simply ignore the price value construct when applying the UTAUT2 model in technology use studies in the educational context. This study extends the UTAUT2 framework by integrating the learning value construct and provides fresh insight about predictors of students' intentions towards LMS and its use. A quantitative research approach was employed by utilizing a closed-ended questionnaire to collect data from Malaysian university students who were users of LMS. Probability proportional stratified sampling was employed to select an appropriate sample. The results indicated a good measurement and structural model fit and suggested the significant influence of performance expectancy, social influence and learning value on students' intention towards LMS and also confirmed the influence of facilitating conditions and behavioral intention on LMS use.

REC_09138,Ethical climate and nurse competence—Newly graduated nurses' perceptions,"Background: Nursing practice takes place in a social framework, in which environmental elements and interpersonal relations interact. Ethical climate of the work unit is an important element affecting nurses’ professional and ethical practice. Nevertheless, whatever the environmental circumstances, nurses are expected to be professionally competent providing high-quality care ethically and clinically. Aim: This study examined newly graduated nurses’ perception of the ethical climate of their work environment and its association with their self-assessed professional competence, turnover intentions and job satisfaction. Method: Descriptive, cross-sectional, correlational research design was applied. Participants consisted of 318 newly graduated nurses. Data were collected electronically and analysed statistically. Ethical considerations: Ethical approval and permissions to use instruments and conduct the study were obtained according to required procedures. Data were rendered anonymous to protect participant confidentiality. Completing the questionnaire was interpreted as consent to participate. Findings: Nurses’ overall perception of the ethical climate was positive. More positive perceptions related to peers, patients and physicians, and less positive to hospitals and managers. Strong associations were found between perceived ethical climate and self-assessed competence, turnover intentions in terms of changing job, and job satisfaction in terms of quality of care. Nurses at a higher competence level with positive views of job satisfaction and low turnover intentions perceived the climate significantly more positively. Conclusion: Nursing management responsible for and having the power to implement changes should understand their contribution in ethical leadership, as well as the multidimensional nature of nurses’ work environment and the interaction between work-related factors in planning developmental measures. Future research should focus on issues in nurse managers’ ethical leadership in creating ethical work environments. There is also a need for knowledge of newly graduated nurses’ views of factors which act as enhancers or barriers to positive ethical climates to develop. Interventions, continuing education courses, and discussions designed to promote positive ethical climates should be developed for managers, nurses, and multi-professional teams.

REC_09519,"Assessing evolutionary theory knowledge performance among Brazilian undergraduates: exploring political and religious affiliation differences and gender, ethnicity, and socioeconomic inequalities","Background: Evolutionary Theory (ET) is a central framework in the biological sciences, guiding understanding across diverse fields. Despite its foundational importance, knowledge and acceptance of ET remain uneven, often influenced by socioeconomic and cultural factors. Misconceptions about ET have been widely documented and are frequently linked to students’ backgrounds, including their political views, gender, race/ethnicity, and economic status. Socioeconomic disparities, particularly within culturally and politically polarized societies, can shape students’ perceptions and understanding of scientific concepts, potentially leading to gaps in scientific literacy. We investigate how these factors relate to ET knowledge among Brazilian undergraduates, aiming to highlight the role of social characteristics in shaping science education outcomes. Results: Our survey of 812 undergraduates revealed significant correlations between ET knowledge and each assessed variable. Students identifying as men achieved higher scores than students identifying as women, and White students outperformed Black and Brown students. Political orientation also influenced performance, with left-leaning students scoring higher than those on the right. Family income positively correlated with ET knowledge, with students from wealthier backgrounds achieving better scores. Regarding religious affiliation, Christian students obtained lower scores when compared to other religious affiliations. Conclusions: Gender, ethnicity, political orientation, religious affiliation, and family income are significant predictors of ET knowledge among Brazilian undergraduates, underscoring the role of socioeconomic disparities in scientific understanding. Marginalized groups may face educational barriers that impact their comprehension of core scientific concepts like ET. Addressing these disparities through culturally inclusive teaching strategies could foster more equitable learning settings. By prioritizing inclusive educational approaches, institutions can support diverse learners in achieving greater scientific literacy, which is essential for informed decision-making and active participation in societal and environmental issues. © The Author(s) 2025.","Demétrio, G.R.; Diele-Viegas, L.M.; Da, H.R.; Jacobina, U.P.; Barão, K.R.",2025,Evolution: Education and Outreach,10.1186/s12052-025-00222-7,18,1,nan-nan,English,Darwinism; Learning bias; Socioeconomic factors; Teaching bias,19366426,Article,Scopus
REC_09607,"Psychiatrists’ and trainees’ knowledge, perception, and readiness for integration of artificial intelligence in mental health care in Nigeria","Background: Artificial intelligence (AI) is revolutionising healthcare globally, including in Nigeria. AI is promising in psychiatry, particularly in addressing the shortage of psychiatrists and rural healthcare gaps. However, research on AI adoption among Nigerian psychiatrists is unavailable. Aims: This study assesses Nigerian psychiatrists’ and trainees’ knowledge, perception, and readiness toward AI adoption in psychiatric practice. Methods: An online cross-sectional survey was conducted using a convenience sample of 200 psychiatrists and trainees. Participants completed a structured online questionnaire assessing demographics, knowledge, perception, and readiness for AI adoption in psychiatry. Results: The mean age of the participants is 39 years (Range: 26–68). Most (86.5%) were aware of AI’s usefulness in psychiatric practice, particularly in diagnostic assistance (54%), patient monitoring (60%) and predicting outcomes (59%). However, only 38.5% were familiar with its use. About 73.5% had a positive perception towards AI integration in psychiatry; Most agreed to AI’s potential benefits in the standardisation and personalisation of care plans (63%), addressing the shortage of psychiatrists (61%), minimises bias (73.5%), and prompt help-seeking behaviour among patients (68%). Respondents were sceptical about AI surpassing average psychiatrists in tasks requiring empathy (91.0% unlikely) and mental status examinations (68% unlikely). Data security, potential loss of human interaction, and diminished empathy were significant concerns. Only 29.5% had used AI-based tools, and 79.5% expressed future adoption readiness.

A growing number of medical schools have begun to incorporate culinary medicine, an evidence-based discipline that offers an experiential learning approach to improve student's education in nutrition and address food-related social determinants of health.MethodsIn the fall of 2023, a culinary medicine pilot program was implemented for first-year medical students at the Larner College of Medicine (LCOM), aimed at increasing their nutrition knowledge and counseling skills. The course was led and developed by two second-year medical students certified in dietetics and integrative health with oversight provided by faculty physicians board-certified in family medicine and lifestyle medicine. The program included five sessions, each focusing on a different chronic disease. Each session consisted of a 45-min didactic lesson followed by a 45-min culinary medicine experiential lesson. The program took place in medical education classrooms utilizing small appliances and low-cost ingredients. The pilot program was evaluated by a post-program survey, which measured perceived knowledge, confidence, and intention to apply learning in clinical practice and personal life.ResultsThe program included 26 first year medical students. The post-program survey revealed that 86% of respondents agreed they would use the information learned in the course in their future clinical practice, and 100% agreed they would apply this knowledge in their own lives. Ninety-one percent reported an enhanced understanding of the relationship between diet and disease, and 95% indicated increased confidence in providing nutrition counseling, particularly regarding social determinants of health.ConclusionThese results demonstrate the benefits of a low-cost educational model of culinary medicine. Its potential to increase future physicians'nutrition knowledge and improve their confidence in providing meaningful, evidence-based dietary guidance is considerable.","Krumholz, S; Hurd, M; Tenney, A; Iacono, L; Vollbrecht, C; Calkins, W",2025,BMC MEDICAL EDUCATION,10.1186/s12909-025-07103-z,25.0,1,nan-nan,English,Nutrition; Culinary Medicine; Medical Education,,Article,WoS; Scopus
REC_10009,Professional quality of life profiles and its associations with turnover intention and life satisfaction among nurses: A prospective longitudinal study,"Background: Nursing shortage is a global issue. Turnover intention and life satisfaction are significant predictors of turnover. The specific nature of nursing and stressful work schedules lead to impaired professional quality of life (ProQOL), and existing studies have confirmed the effect of a dimension of ProQOL (such as secondary trauma stress, burnout and compassion satisfaction) on turnover intention and life satisfaction. Yet the heterogeneity of ProQOL across individuals is not known. A lack of research on the relationship between potential ProQOL subgroups and turnover intention and life satisfaction, and the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain understudied. The study aimed to determine different ProQOL profiles, and their cross-sectional and longitudinal effects on turnover intention and life satisfaction, while exploring the mediating roles of job satisfaction and work engagement within the relationship. Methods: Data were collected at a tertiary hospital in a northeastern province of China. An online questionnaire was administered twice over the course of six months. 1832 and 900 participates provided cross-sectional and longitudinal data respectively. We used latent profile analysis (LPA) and K-means clustering to identify ProQOL profiles, and used the PROCESS macro program to conduct mediation analysis. Results: The LPA results supported a 4-profile solution, including balanced protection, good quality, traumatic satisfaction and burnout problem. ProQOL profiles directly predicted nurses’ current and subsequent turnover intention and life satisfaction. In addition, job satisfaction and work engagement mediated the effects of ProQOL profiles on turnover intention and life satisfaction in cross-sectional sample, and mediated the effects of ProQOL profiles on turnover intention in longitudinal sample. Conclusion: The findings suggest that nurses’ ProQOL has distinct categorical characteristics and is strongly associated with turnover intention and life satisfaction. Hospital administrators should implement individualized, join management and interventions according to each profile. Furthermore, more attentions should focus on improving nurses’ job satisfaction and work engagement levels to promote good work and life outcomes.

REC_10047,How mental health status and attitudes toward mental health shape AI Acceptance in psychosocial care: A cross-sectional analysis,"Introduction: Artificial Intelligence (AI) has become part of our everyday lives and is also increasingly applied in psychosocial healthcare as it can enhance it, make it more accessible, and reduce barriers for help seeking. User behaviour and readiness for AI can be predicted by various factors, such as perceived usefulness (PU) of AI, personality traits and mental health-related variables. Investigating these factors is essential for understanding user acceptance and the future use of AI tools in mental health. This study examines the individual factors that influence the PU of AI in mental health care. In addition, it examines how PU of AI affects the use of mental health apps. For ethical and practical reasons, these apps were considered independently of their AI integration, aiming to support the development of AI-driven mental health applications. Method: In a German-speaking convenience sample N = 302 participants socio-demographic information, personality factors, mental health status, mental health literacy, and various aspects concerning the integration of AI into psychosocial care (PU, AI awareness, digital skills, app use in general) were assessed. Two linear, stepwise regression analyses were conducted, with PU of AI and the participants’ use of mental health apps in general as dependent variables, respectively, and the above-mentioned variables as predictors. Profession, gender, own experience with mental impairments, AI awareness and digital skills were included as covariates. Finally, we performed two moderation analyses to investigate mental health problems and psychological distress as moderators for the relationship between PU and frequency of mental health-related app use—irrespective of AI integration—with working field and digital capabilities as covariates. Results: Higher openness, pessimism and conscientiousness predicted lower PU, whereas higher agreeableness, lower levels of stigma and social distance predicted higher PU. The covariates psychological/ pedagogical training, digital capabilities and experience had a significant influence on PU. Higher frequency of app use in general was predicted by better digital capabilities, higher psychological distress, and more help seeking behaviour. The relationship between PU and the overall use of mental health apps was moderated by psychological distress but not by mental health problems. Discussion: Our study identified individual factors influencing PU for integrating AI into psychosocial care and the frequency of using mental health apps—irrespective of AI integration—and thereby underlines the necessity to tailor AI interventions in psychosocial care to individual needs, personality, and abilities of users to enhance their acceptance and effectiveness.

REC_10262,Determining Factors Influencing Indonesian Higher Education Students' Intention to Adopt Artificial Intelligence Tools for Self-Directed Learning Management,"Artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized higher education. The rapid adoption of artificial intelligence in education (AIED) tools has significantly transformed educational management, specifically in self-directed learning (SDL). This study examines the factors influencing Indonesian higher education students' intention to adopt AIED tools for self-directed learning using a combination of the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) with additional theories. A total of 322 university students from diverse academic backgrounds participated in the structured survey. This study utilized machine learning it was Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to analyze nine factors, including attitude (AT), subjective norms (SN), perceived behavioral control (PBC), optimism (OP), user innovativeness (UI), perceived usefulness (PUF), facilitating conditions (FC), perception towards ai (PTA), and intention (IT) with a total of 41 items in the questionnaire. The model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with SN emerging as the most significant factor to IT, followed by AT, PBC, PUF, FC, OP, and PTA. User innovativeness was the least influential factor due to the lowest accuracy. This study provides actionable insights for educators, policymakers, and technology developers by highlighting the critical roles of social influence, supportive infrastructure, and student beliefs in shaping AIED adoption for self-directed learning (SDL). This research not only fills an important gap in the literature but also offers a roadmap for designing inclusive, student-centered AI learning environments that empower learners and support the future of SDL in digital education. © 2025 The Author(s)","Darmono; Setiawan, R.J.; Ma’ruf, K.",2025,European Journal of Educational Research,10.12973/eu-jer.14.3.805,14,3,805-828,English,Artificial intelligence; artificial neural networks; educational management; intention; self-directed learning,,Article,Scopus
REC_10276,The relationship between burnout and engagement with the self-efficacy and self-regulation of college students in distance courses,"The educational scenario brings us numerous challenges and concerns, among them, the increase in levels of stress and ex-haustion in university students in a post-pandemic context. In the literature, researchers have focused on the risks of burnout and its effects in different contexts, including the educational one, so it is necessary to expand this perspective, relating it to factors that impact students. In this sense, the objective of this work is to present an integrated model, in which the mediating effect of self-efficacy, engagement and self-regulation with re-gard to student burnout was tested. The sample submitted to the study consisted of 941 students enrolled in distance gradua-tion courses. Due to the characteristics of the research, the sta-tistical technique used was structural equation modeling. The results have implications: such as explaining the relationships through a structural model in which it was possible to identify that burnout negatively impacts self-efficacy and engagement, which, in turn, positively impact self-regulation. The contribution is related to the validation and development of the integrated model composed of second-order constructs. In addition, the mediation of the engagement and self-regulation constructs was identified, according to the Brazilian educational reality.","de Lima, KMR; de Moraes, EA",2023,ADMINISTRACAO-ENSINO E PESQUISA,10.13058/raep.2023.v24n1.2356,24.0,1,140-191,English,Burnout; Self-efficacy; Engagement; Self-regula- tion,2177-6083,Article,WoS
REC_10410,Autonomous and informed decision-making: The case of colorectal cancer screening,"Introduction: It is increasingly considered important that people make an autonomous and informed decision concerning colorectal cancer (CRC) screening. However, the realisation of autonomy within the concept of informed decision-making might be interpreted too narrowly. Additionally, relatively little is known about what the eligible population believes to be a 'good' screening decision. Therefore, we aimed to explore how the concepts of autonomous and informed decision-making relate to how the eligible CRC screening population makes their decision and when they believe to have made a 'good' screening decision. Methods: We conducted 27 semi-structured interviews with the eligible CRC screening population (eighteen CRC screening participants and nine non-participants). The general topics discussed concerned how people made their CRC screening decision, how they experienced making this decision and when they considered they had made a 'good' decision. Results: Most interviewees viewed a 'good' CRC screening decision as one based on both reasoning and feeling/intuition, and that is made freely. However, many CRC screening non-participants experienced a certain social pressure to participate. All CRC screening non-participants viewed making an informed decision as essential. This appeared to be the case to a lesser extent for CRC screening participants. For most, experiences and values were involved in their decision-making. Conclusion: Our sample of the eligible CRC screening population viewed aspects related to the concepts of autonomous and informed decision-making as important for making a 'good' CRC screening decision. However, in particular the existence of a social norm may be affecting a true autonomous decision-making process. Additionally, the present concept of informed decision-making with its strong emphasis on making a fully informed and well-considered decision does not appear to be entirely reflective of the process in practice. More efforts could be made to attune to the diverse values and factors that are involved in deciding about CRC screening participation.

REC_10797,Exploring the Impact of E-Learning Initiatives on Students' Self-Efficacy and E-Learning Experiences,"Purpose: This research endeavours to investigate the intermediary role played by self-efficacy within the context of e-learning, elucidating its mediating influence on the association among multiple factors. These factors include the perceived impact of elearning, the efficacy of recommendations concerning e-learning, computer usability, alignment with learning styles, motivational dynamics within elearning, and students' encounters within e-learning environments. Methodology: Data were gathered from a cohort of 248 students participating in diverse E-learning programs across multiple universities in Saudi Arabia. In order to address the absence of a definitive roster or enumeration of students enrolled in various E-learning programs, a simple random sampling method was employed to solicit responses from this student population. The quantitative research methodology adopted for this study involved the dissemination of surveys to a subset of students currently engaged in e-learning courses. Research Findings: The study revealed that self-efficacy in E-learning serves as a mediator between various factors including perceived impacts on E-learning, computer utilization, learning style adaptation, and learning motivation. However, it does not act as a mediator between the perceived usefulness of Elearning suggestions and students' E-learning experiences. These findings underscore the pivotal role of self-efficacy in shaping students' online learning experiences, emphasizing the importance of fostering positive individual beliefs and attitudes to enhance the effectiveness of online learning endeavours.

REC_11628,Investigating the State of Self-Expression and its Relationship with Adjustment and Self-Efficacy of Students: Evidence From a Cross-sectional Study in Southern Iran,"Introduction: The ability to express themselves, adjustment, and self-efficacy play an important role in the academic success of students. The purpose of this research was to investigate the state of self-expression and its relationship with adjustment and self-efficacy of University students of Medical Sciences in 2024. Methods: This descriptive-analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 290 students of various fields studying in the first semester of 2023-2024. Data were collected using standard self-expression, adjustment, and self-efficacy questionnaires. Data were analyzed with SPSS software version 23 using descriptive and inferential statistics, and t-test, ANOVA, and Pearson’s correlation coefficient were performed at a 5% significance level. Results: The mean and standard deviation of self-expression, adjustment, and self-efficacy of the students were respectively 92.48 ± 17.36 out of 200, 123.87 ± 15.94 out of 335, and 48.31 ± 11.25 out of 85. This indicates the average level of self-expression and self-efficacy, as well as poor adjustment. Also, a statistically significant direct correlation was observed between self-expression with adjustment (p=0.002, r=0.328) and self-efficacy (p<0.001, r=0.516). Conclusion: Self-expression and self-efficacy were estimated at a medium level, and adjustment was estimated at a low level. Based on the results, with the improvement of self-expression, the students adjustment and self-efficacy will improve. Therefore, it is suggested that the officials of the university provide the conditions for improving the self-expression of students through educational workshops and increase their self-confidence and self-esteem. Subsequently, paying attention to the needs of students and trying to solve their problems will help to reduce incompatibility. © 2024 The Author(s).","Yusefi, A.R.; Nasabi, N.S.; Bahmaei, J.; Askarpour, H.; Bordbar, S.",2024,Open Public Health Journal,10.2174/0118749445337418240905104211,17,,nan-nan,English,Adjustment; Data; Self-confidence; Self-efficacy; Self-expression; Student,,Article,Scopus
REC_11686,Understanding the function constitution and influence factors on communication for the WeChat official account of top tertiary hospitals in China: Cross-sectional study,"Background: Widespread adoption and continued developments in mobile health care technologies have led to the improved accessibility and quality of medical services. In China, WeChat, an instant messaging and social networking app released by the company Tencent, has developed a specific type of user account called WeChat official account (WOA), which is now widely adopted by hospitals in China. It enables health care providers to connect with local citizens, allowing them to, among other actions, send regular updates through mass circulation. However, with the diversity in function provided by WOA, little is known about its major constitution as well as the influence factors on the WeChat communication index (WCI). The WCI has been widely used in social media impact ranking with various types of WeChat content to fully reflect the dissemination and coverage of tweets as well as the maturity and impact of WOA. Objective: There are two typical WOAs available to users, namely, WeChat subscription account (WSSA) and WeChat service account (WSVA). The biggest difference between them is the frequency of messages transmitted. This study aimed to explore the function constitution of WSVA adopted by top tertiary hospitals in China and the major contributors of the WCI score. Methods: A total of 681 top tertiary hospitals were selected from the Hospital Quality Monitoring System; the WOA of every top tertiary hospital was retrieved in the WeChat app. We divided core functional items of WSVAs using categorical principal component analysis. To elicit the factors that influenced the use of WSVA, quantile regression was employed to analyze the WCI score. Results: From the 668 WOAs identified, adoption of WSVAs (543/668, 81.3%) was more than that of WSSAs (125/668, 18.7%). Functional items of WSVAs were categorized into four clusters: (1) hospital introduction, (2) medical services, (3) visiting assistants, and (4) others. With regard to the influence factors on the WCI, the impact of the activity index of WSVA and the total visiting number of outpatients and emergencies on WCI were statistically significant and positive in all quantiles. However, the year of certification, the type of hospital, the year of public hospital reform, and the number of beds merely affected the WCI at some quantiles. Conclusions: Our findings are considered helpful to tertiary hospitals in developing in-depth functional items that improve patient experience. The tertiary hospitals should take full advantage of times of posting and provide high-quality tweets to meet the various needs of patients.

REC_11852,Characterizing the adoption and experiences of users of artificial intelligence–generated health information in the United States: Cross-sectional questionnaire study,"Background: OpenAI's ChatGPT is a source of advanced online health information (OHI) that may be integrated into individuals' health information-seeking routines. However, concerns have been raised about its factual accuracy and impact on health outcomes. To forecast implications for medical practice and public health, more information is needed on who uses the tool, how often, and for what. Objective: This study aims to characterize the reasons for and types of ChatGPT OHI use and describe the users most likely to engage with the platform. Methods: In this cross-sectional survey, patients received invitations to participate via the ResearchMatch platform, a nonprofit affiliate of the National Institutes of Health. A web-based survey measured demographic characteristics, use of ChatGPT and other sources of OHI, experience characterization, and resultant health behaviors. Descriptive statistics were used to summarize the data. Both 2-tailed t tests and Pearson chi-square tests were used to compare users of ChatGPT OHI to nonusers. Results: Of 2406 respondents, 21.5% (n=517) respondents reported using ChatGPT for OHI. ChatGPT users were younger than nonusers (32.8 vs 39.1 years, P<.001) with lower advanced degree attainment (BA or higher; 49.9% vs 67%, P<.001) and greater use of transient health care (ED and urgent care; P<.001). ChatGPT users were more avid consumers of general non-ChatGPT OHI (percentage of weekly or greater OHI seeking frequency in past 6 months, 28.2% vs 22.8%, P<.001). Around 39.3% (n=206) respondents endorsed using the platform for OHI 2-3 times weekly or more, and most sought the tool to determine if a consultation was required (47.4%, n=245) or to explore alternative treatment (46.2%, n=239). Use characterization was favorable as many believed ChatGPT to be just as or more useful than other OHIs (87.7%, n=429) and their doctor (81%, n=407). About one-third of respondents requested a referral (35.6%, n=184) or changed medications (31%, n=160) based on the information received from ChatGPT. As many users reported skepticism regarding the ChatGPT output (67.9%, n=336), most turned to their physicians (67.5%, n=349). Conclusions: This study underscores the significant role of AI-generated OHI in shaping health-seeking behaviors and the potential evolution of patient-provider interactions. Given the proclivity of these users to enact health behavior changes based on AI-generated content, there is an opportunity for physicians to guide ChatGPT OHI users on an informed and examined use of the technology.

REC_12377,Investigating the Adoption of Metaverse-Based Immersive Learning in TESOL,"This study investigates the adoption of Metaverse-based immersive learning in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), an area that has been understudied and lacks an understanding of factors influencing the acceptance of this digital platform. In contrast to traditional mobile or e-learning, the Metaverse facilitates all sorts of unique immersive experiences including virtual simulations and cultural dialogues that can aid your process for language acquisition and cultural understanding. However, its reception in the field of TESOL is yet to be substantiated through empirical evidence. The present study explores the effects of constructs such as Perceived ease of use (PEU), Perceived usefulness (PUS), Attitude (ATT), Subjective norm (SBN) and Perceived behavioural control (PBC) on students' Intention to Use Metaverse (IUM) in TESOL context. Data collected from 736 university students in Jordan were analyzed using structural equation modelling (SEM) with a combined Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) and Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) framework. Results indicate that in terms of direct effects, PEU strongly influences ATT (β = 0.566) and SBN (β = 0.448), whereas PUS regulates ATT (β = 0.514) and SBN (β= 0.482). Path coefficients for the predictive factors of IUM—ATT, SBN, and PBC were 0.326, 0.641, and 0.516 respectively. A J48 decision tree validated by machine learning was able to predict 91.22% of IUM with good accuracy. The results reveal that Metaverse-based TESOL has gradually become part of student habits despite their limited access to technology.

REC_12458,Investigating EFL Learners’ Perceptions of Using AI to Enhance English Vocabulary Acquisition Based on The Technology Acceptance Model,"The technological advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) has been shown to confer significant benefits in both technical and educational realms. Accordingly, the study aims to investigate learners’ perspectives on AI tools and attempts to assess which aspects of these tools are useful in improving vocabulary acquisition in a Saudi context. A structured questionnaire was designed based on the technology acceptance model (TAM) by using a quantitative method, and distributed to 112 undergraduate students from different colleges in Saudi Arabia, the majority of whom are Generation Z. The findings revealed that EFL learners generally hold a favorable view of AI tools for vocabulary acquisition, and gender differences were found to be statistically significant (p < 0.00) where female respondents report greater scores in terms of ease of use, usefulness, positive attitudes, and their intentions toward adoption. In addition, a person’s intention to adopt technology is primarily influenced by their assessment of its positive attitudes, followed by its simplicity and benefits of use. This study provides a deeper understanding about implementing AI tools to enhance EFL learners’ English vocabulary acquisition. The results can also nudge teachers and policymakers to further enhance their instructional strategies in ways that foster a more engaging and supportive environment for vocabulary growth. © © 2025 by the author(s).","Alsakaker, S.M.",2025,Forum for Linguistic Studies,10.30564/fls.v7i2.8593,7,2,nan-nan,English,Artificial Intelligence (AI); EFL Learners; EFL Vocabulary Learning; Students’ Perceptions; Technology Acceptance Model; Vocabulary Acquisition,27050610,Article,Scopus
REC_12525,Measuring wheelchair confidence among power wheelchair users: An adaptation of the WheelCon-M using focus groups and a think aloud process,"Purpose: The aim of this study was to adapt the WheelCon-M, an outcome measure used to assess confidence with manual wheelchair use, into a version that is applicable for power wheelchair users (WheelCon-P).Methods: Adaptation of the WheelCon-M into the WheelCon-P occurred in two phases: (1) item modification was conducted using focus groups and (2) item refinement was done using a think aloud process. Results: The healthcare professionals (n = 12) were mostly female, mostly occupational therapists and practiced an average of 14 years. The power wheelchair users (n = 8) were 50% men with an average of 8 years of power wheelchair experience and a range of diagnoses. In phase 1, of the 63 WheelCon-M items, 6 remained the same, 18 were removed, 38 modified and 15 new items added to develop the WheelCon-P. In phase 2, 15 WheelCon-P items were refined. Conclusions: This study resulted in the modification of the WheelCon-M into the WheelCon-P, a 59-item, self-report outcome measure designed to assess confidence with power wheelchair use. The next step in the evolution of this promising new measure is the assessment of its measurement properties. Implications for Rehabilitation: 1. The WheelCon-P is a new outcome measure designed to assess confidence with power wheelchair use. 2. This study suggests that the items in this measure will be interpreted as intended.

The latters have always been called upon to promote students’ employability and, in recent years, to combine this objective with digital transformations and the challenges they entail, without forgetting the promotion of well-being. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the role of perceived employability in the relationship between technostress related to distance education and the well-being of university students. A total of 242 university students, mainly females, completed a self-report questionnaire including measures to assess technostress related to distance education, internal perceived employability, external perceived employability, and psychological well-being. Statistical analyses reported significant associations between technostress and the other variables evaluated, except for internal perceived employability. Moreover, internal perceived employability emerged as a potential mediator in the relationship between technostress and well-being.

REC_12829,Pre-service teachers' knowledge of evidence-based classroom management practices in physical education: a test validation using item response theory,"This study validated an assessment instrument measuring pre-service teachers' professional knowledge of evidence-based classroom management practices in physical education. Drawing on a model of teacher competence that integrates knowledge, situation-specific skills, and performance, the study focused on the competence area of classroom management to ensure conceptual clarity and relevance. Data from 877 pre-service primary education teachers from four universities of teacher education were analyzed using item response theory to examine the instrument's structure and psychometric properties. The findings indicate a unidimensional structure with satisfactory reliability and no evidence of bias related to demographic variables. Test scores showed a small positive correlation with situation-specific skills, reflecting construct validity, as these require additional distinct cognitive abilities while being conceptually related. However, the test's items proved relatively easy, resulting in a mismatch between item difficulty and participant ability levels, and did not capture the expected differences across pre-service teachers at different stages of their training, potentially due to a ceiling effect. Together, these findings limit the test's capacity to differentiate among higher-ability individuals, thereby constraining criterion validity. Despite these limitations, the results demonstrate the instrument's capacity to measure knowledge about evidence-based practices in classroom management. Further refinement could enhance its discriminatory power at advanced knowledge levels. This assessment provides a foundation for exploring how knowledge shapes teachers' perception, interpretation, decision-making, and performance, and could support efforts in teacher education to develop effective classroom management practices.","Berthold, C; Jeisy, E; Baumgartner, M",2025,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,10.3389/feduc.2025.1570510,10.0,,nan-nan,English,physical education; evidence-based practice; declarative knowledge; test development; test validation; professional competence; classroom management,,Article,WoS
REC_12844,Exploring the acceptance of ChatGPT in higher education: a comprehensive quantitative study of university students and faculty,"The study explores the acceptance and use of ChatGPT in higher education, focusing on university students and faculty members. The research aims to identify the factors that influence the behavioral intention to use ChatGPT, utilizing the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology 2 (UTAUT2) as the theoretical framework. Key constructs such as performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence, facilitating conditions, hedonic motivation, price value, and habit were examined for their impact on the acceptance of ChatGPT. Data were collected through a survey of 378 participants, including 346 students and 32 faculty members, from various faculties at a university in Eastern Europe. The findings reveal that effort expectancy and performance expectancy were the most significant predictors of behavioral intention to use ChatGPT. Faculty members demonstrated a higher intention to use ChatGPT compared to students, likely due to their greater experience with technology. Hedonic motivation also played an important role in both groups, indicating that enjoyment contributed to the acceptance of the tool. The study concludes that ChatGPT holds great potential for enhancing education, but its habitual use is not yet widespread. The results suggest that universities should focus on improving institutional support and training to facilitate broader acceptance of ChatGPT among students and faculty.","Kaya, MH; Adigüzel, T",2025,FRONTIERS IN EDUCATION,10.3389/feduc.2025.1652292,10.0,,nan-nan,English,ChatGPT acceptance; higher education; UTAUT2 framework; student and faculty perceptions; AI,,Article,WoS; Scopus

REC_13219,Service staff encounters with dysfunctional customer behavior: Does supervisor support mitigate negative emotions?,"Dysfunctional customer behavior is common in service settings. For frontline employees, negative encounters can cause short-term despondency or have profound, long-term psychological effects that often result in both direct and indirect costs to service firms. Existing research has explored the influence of dysfunctional customer behavior on employee emotions, but it has not fully investigated the psychological mechanism through which customer misbehavior transforms into employee responses. To maintain service quality and employee well-being, it is important to understand the impact of customer misconduct on employee emotions and its effect on subsequent service behavior. To assess the process through which dysfunctional customer behavior manifests as negative emotions in frontline service employees, and the influence of negative employee emotions on their prosocial service behavior, we surveyed 185 frontline banking service employees. We sought information on service employee experiences, attitudes, and feelings regarding dysfunctional customer behaviors, the perceived level of supervisor support, and employee prosocial service behavior intentions. Structural equation modeling and hierarchical linear modeling were used for statistical analysis and hypothesis verification. Results indicate that dysfunctional customer behavior has a positive relationship with bank service employee negative emotions and a negative influence on employee prosocial service behavior. The study found that negative emotions fully mediated the relationship between dysfunctional customer behavior and prosocial service behavior. The moderating role that perceived supervisor support plays on the relationships between dysfunctional customer behavior and negative emotion was also investigated. The results show that perceived supervisor support moderates the relationship between dysfunctional customer behavior and negative employee emotions. Finally, the study provides bank managers with effective strategies to assist frontline employees to manage and deter dysfunctional customer behavior, and presents employees with internal recovery strategies when encountering dysfunctional customer behavior.

Data analysis included descriptive stats, partial correlations, mediation and moderation effects.Results (1) Parent-child attachment (including its sub-dimensions: father attachment and mother attachment), family resilience (including its sub-dimensions: family beliefs and family strength), and fertility intention show significant positive correlations; (2) Total scores of parent- child attachment and family resilience positively predict fertility intention- Specifically, father attachment (rather than mother attachment) and family beliefs (rather than family strength) positively predict fertility intention; (3) After controlling for variables such as family economic status, family beliefs partially mediate the relationship between father attachment and future fertility intention; (4) Both segments of the mediating pathway are significantly moderated by gender- Male's father attachment has a stronger promoting effect on family beliefs than female's, male's family beliefs directly drive fertility intention, while female's family beliefs do not directly influence fertility intention.Conclusion This study clarified the core role path of 'father attachment -> family beliefs -> fertility intentions,' and found that men are more likely to form family beliefs through father attachment, which can directly drive their fertility intentions, while women's fertility intentions need to be improved by alleviating actual fertility costs. This result not only provides new evidence for the theoretical mechanism of ' parent-child relationships affecting fertility intentions,' but also offers practical basis for formulating fertility intention enhancement strategies differentiated by gender and dimension.","Li, GY; You, ZQ; Yang, GH",2025,FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY,10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1669639,16.0,,nan-nan,English,parent-child attachment; family resilience; fertility intention; father attachment; mother attachment; family beliefs; family strength; gender,1664-1078,Article,WoS; Scopus

REC_14495,Efficacy of the Technology Satisfaction Model (TSM): An Empirical Study,"With the rapid uptake of the Internet and e-learning systems worldwide, online research databases have become necessary, even indispensable, tools for research and learning. The International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) recognizes the huge potential of databases in improving educational outcomes, and in promoting research among its students and academic staff. In line with its aim to become a research university and centre for educational excellence, the IIUM introduced its online database system in 2000 as part of its e-library services. However; despite a decade of existence, the database was found to be underutilized, especially by postgraduate students. As such, the prime objective of this study is to validate the Technology Satisfaction Model (TSM) to assess its efficacy on students ' satisfaction in using online research databases in higher education. A total of 180 postgraduate students from four faculties (Education, Human Sciences, Engineering and Economics) were selected using stratified random sampling procedure. The questionnaires' reliability and validity were performed through a Rasch model using Winsteps version 3.49. The data were analyzed applying the Structural Equation Modeling to test the hypotheses of TSM. The results of this study revealed that computer self-efficacy had a statistically significant direct influence on perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Subsequently, students' perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness had statistically significant positive direct influence on their satisfaction in using online research databases. On the other hand, computer self-efficacy had a significant indirect influence on satisfaction mediated by perceived ease of use. Finally, computer self-efficacy also demonstrated a statistically significant indirect influence on satisfaction mediated by perceived usefulness of databases. The findings contributed that the TSM is viable to examine the successful integration of online research databases among postgraduate students in higher education.","Islam, AYMA; Leng, CH; Singh, D",2015,INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF TECHNOLOGY AND HUMAN INTERACTION,10.4018/ijthi.2015040103,11.0,2,45-60,English,Higher Education; Online Research Databases; Rasch Model; Structural Equation Modeling; Technology Satisfaction Model,1548-3908,Article,WoS; Scopus; PsycINFO
REC_14593,The impact to demographic and academic factors on metacognition and academic self-efficacy: A study on Iranian students in health sciences,"BACKGROUND: Metacognition and academic self-efficacy are two emerging resources in the process of learning. Basic levels of metacognition and academic self-efficacy may differ and be influenced by demographic and academic factors. This study investigated impacts of demographic and academic factors on metacognition, metacognitive skills, and academic self-efficacy in health sciences students. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 404 participating students attending various fields of study in health sciences at Shahrekord University of Medical Sciences. Demographic and academic data were collected. Global metacognition, metacognitive skills, and academic self-efficacy scores were assessed using published or online questionnaires. Means were compared using Student's t-test, whereas intra- and intergroups' scores were compared using one-way ANOVA test. RESULTS: Global metacognition and academic self-efficacy were not impacted by demographic students' status. The gender and age impacted both knowledge and control of process- planning (favoring male gender), as well knowledge and control-of-self (disfavoring 20-30 age class) of metacognitive skills, (P < 0.05). Academic status did not influence academic self-efficacy. The school type influenced the metacognitive skill component to knowledge and control of process-regulation (disfavoring nursing school) (P < 0.05). The academic discipline impacted the global metacognition (P < 0.05) and its knowledge and control of self-component (P < 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Demographic and academic status does impact metacognitive skills and global metacognition scores. Given the heterogeneous level to innate metacognitive skills, this study sheds lights on usefulness to screen learners' subgroups that require supplementary educational instructions to uniformly optimize metacognitive skills.","Raeisi, E; Solati, K; Aazami, MH; Shamsipour, N; Sadeghian, Z; Ahmady, S",2020,JOURNAL OF EDUCATION AND HEALTH PROMOTION,10.4103/jehp.jehp_519_19,9.0,1,nan-nan,English,Demography; learning; medical education; metacognition; self-efficacy,2277-9531,Article,WoS; Scopus

REC_16067,Emotional intelligence and Machiavellianism: A meta-analysis,"Emotional intelligence (EI) has spurred great interest over the last decades for its promising applications in life, work, and education. Research has mainly focused on the positive effects of emotional intelligence, although the appraisal, control and regulation of emotions can potentially lead to negative outcomes followed by adoption of non-cooperative behavioral strategies, such as Machiavellianism. The aim of the present study was to examine whether there is negative correlation between emotional intelligence and Machiavellianism. To determine whether high EI levels are associated with low Machiavellianism levels, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted by combining the results of multiple studies concerning the relationship of EI with Machiavellianism. Correlation coefficients were considered as the effect size of examination. Of the publications identified, a total of 29 studies from 17 published papers met the inclusion criteria according to the meta-analysis methodology. Study characteristics and reported results revealed high heterogeneity across the studies included. Estimates of r = -.267 and r = -.25 in the meta-analysis process with fixed effect and random effects models, respectively, confirmed the negative relationship between emotional intelligence and Machiavellianism.
