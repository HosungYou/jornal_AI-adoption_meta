Implications for instructors policy and practice are discussed.","Zhang, U.; Watanabe, I.; Wang, W.; Nguyen, I.; White, E.",2023,International Journal of Educational Technology in Higher Education,10.2364/54bdede3,55.0,,116-614,English,artificial intelligence; undergraduate; anxiety; generative AI; behavioral intention; neural network,7995-2106,article,Scopus
16172,How does UTAUT shape machine learning outcomes in e-learning?,"This study examines the facilitating conditions of machine learning technology in university contexts. Using a survey of 855 participants, we applied structural equation modeling to test an extended UTAUT framework. Results indicate that acceptance significantly predicts behavioral intention. Implications for university policy and practice are discussed.","Davis, K.; Nguyen, I.",2025,SAGE Open,10.6658/7a036edb,69.0,9.0,345-610,English,GPT-4; MOOC; deep learning,,article,WoS
