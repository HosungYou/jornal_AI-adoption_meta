interpretation_notes:
  - "Model 1 tests whether traditional TAM/UTAUT constructs alone explain educational AI adoption"
  - "If Model 1 shows good fit, educational AI adoption may not require AI-specific constructs"
  - "If Model 1 shows poor fit or low R², suggests education-specific AI factors are needed"
  - "Comparison to Scherer et al. (2019) teacher technology meta-analysis: test if educational AI differs from general educational technology"

limitations:
  - "Does not include AI-specific constructs (trust, anxiety, transparency, autonomy)"
  - "Assumes educational AI adoption follows same mechanisms as traditional educational technology adoption"
  - "May underestimate variance explained if AI-specific factors are important in education contexts"
