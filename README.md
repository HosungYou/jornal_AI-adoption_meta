# AI Adoption in Education: A Meta-Analytic Structural Equation Model Integrating Trust, Anxiety, Transparency, and Autonomy

> A comprehensive meta-analytic structural equation modeling study synthesizing AI adoption research in educational contexts to test the validity of TAM/UTAUT frameworks for educational AI technologies.

**Target Journal:** *Computers & Education* (Impact Factor: 12.0, Elsevier)

## Research Questions

1. **RQ1**: To what extent do TAM/UTAUT path relationships hold in the educational AI adoption context? (TSSEM on 12-construct model)
2. **RQ2**: Do AI-specific constructs (Trust, Anxiety, Transparency, Autonomy) provide incremental explanatory power beyond traditional TAM/UTAUT variables in educational settings? (Competing models comparison)
3. **RQ3**: How do educational contextual factors (education level, user role, discipline, AI tool type, institutional type, cultural context, temporal period) moderate the structural relationships? (OSMASEM + subgroup analysis)

## Theoretical Framework

Extended 12-construct model integrating TAM, UTAUT, and AI-specific variables:

| # | Construct | Abbr | Origin |
|---|-----------|------|--------|
| 1 | Performance Expectancy | PE | TAM/UTAUT |
| 2 | Effort Expectancy | EE | TAM/UTAUT |
| 3 | Social Influence | SI | UTAUT |
| 4 | Facilitating Conditions | FC | UTAUT |
| 5 | Behavioral Intention | BI | TAM/UTAUT |
| 6 | Use Behavior | UB | TAM/UTAUT |
| 7 | Attitude | ATT | TAM |
| 8 | Self-Efficacy | SE | SCT |
| 9 | AI Trust | TRU | AI-specific |
| 10 | AI Anxiety | ANX | AI-specific |
| 11 | AI Transparency | TRA | AI-specific |
| 12 | Perceived AI Autonomy | AUT | AI-specific |

→ **66 pairwise correlations** pooled across studies

| 4 | Pre/Post ChatGPT Temporal | `06` | Path changes around 2023 |
| 5 | Meta-Analytic Mediation | `07` | Indirect effects (TRA→TRU→BI) |
| 6 | Heterogeneity Decomposition | `08` | I², τ², prediction intervals |
| 7 | Publication Bias | `09` | Trim-fill, PET-PEESE, selection models |
| 8 | Sensitivity (r-only vs r+β) | `10` | β→r conversion robustness |
| 9 | Bayesian MASEM | `11` | Sabherwal et al. informative priors |
| 10 | Network Analysis (MAGNA) | `12` | Construct centrality, bridge analysis |

## Methodology

- **Population**: Students (K-12, undergraduate, graduate), instructors, educational administrators
- **Context**: AI in teaching, learning, and educational administration (ChatGPT, intelligent tutoring systems, LMS-AI, automated grading, AI writing assistants)
- **Effect size**: Pearson correlations (r), with β→r conversion (Peterson & Brown, 2005) and sensitivity analysis
- **Core method**: Two-Stage Meta-Analytic SEM (TSSEM; Cheung, 2015) via `metaSEM` R package
- **Advanced**: One-Stage MASEM (OSMASEM), Bayesian MASEM (`blavaan`), Network Analysis (`psychonetrics`)
- **AI-assisted screening**: Codex CLI + Gemini CLI (dual-provider OAuth); AI-assisted coding: 3-model consensus pipeline
- **Target k**: ≥ 150 studies (k = 150+ for robust 66-correlation pooled matrix)
- **Actual screening**: 16,189 records → 575 AI-include, 175 conflict, 707 genuine uncertain (human review in progress)
- **Full-text criterion**: ≥ 2 construct-pair r or β among the 12 target constructs
- **Heterogeneity**: Controlled via OSMASEM moderators (ai_tool_type, education_level, publication_year, user_role, cultural_context) rather than narrow inclusion criteria
